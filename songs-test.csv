Deja Vu Heroin Girl,rap,Charles Hamilton,2010,294,{},"[Verse 1]
I hate when girls look too familiar
Cause then I get an unusual feeling
And when I say have we met before It's not because seeing you is a beautiful feeling
I used to binge with friends I shouldn't have had
Most are dead or imaginary, just In the past
But one lady young lady dumb lady
One crazy lover made me 180
We met at a rave party in soho
Great party though I hate parties, I won't go now
Cause a flash backs to back then
So, Let me tell you what happened
L gave me a few tabs of some other shit
I was cooked already, for the fuck of it
No peer pressure, suddenly she grabbed me, kissed me
Before I spoke, she said let's make tonight history
Before tonight is history
My high ass smiled and said I like what this could be, you got a spoon?
She said, do you got a syringe?
And that's how the drama begins...damn
[Hook]
Intoxicating is your smile
But please don't be my heroin girl
You got me standing for a while
But please don't be my heroin girl, my heroin girl

[Verse 2]
I only pop twice, both times with she
I had her wrote rhymes with me
I mean write, don't mind me please
High from memories, driving me to sleep
I dive between the sheets in my Homies mothers bed, where all the raves were
My lonely lover said, one day we gonna not be twisted
We still love each other, we can not be this sick
Deja Vu can't copy this shit
You're Not in your body Charles watch me kiss it
She went down, I went up
Then touch gods fist, what is up
I came down to see that she was down for me
Being down at least, for the sound of me I sang her this ever clear song
It was ever so clear I couldn't ever be more wrong
And I'll forever be a moron
Cause I never even asked her name
We drifted apart, don't know if she passed away
But I remember she would listen to what I had to say
With that I say thanks, my heroin girl
[Hook]
Intoxicating is her smile
But please don't be my heroin girl
You got me standin For a while
But please don't be my heroin girl, my heroin girl


Are you just a memory
Or a twisted lie
And would you remember me
If I caught your eye
So please, say that you're real
And not in my mind, all this time

[Hook]
Intoxicating is her smile
But please don't be my heroin girl
You got me standin For a while
But please don't be my heroin girl, my heroin girl",129831,en,en,en
Introductory Lecture on the Times,misc,Ralph Waldo Emerson,2013,34,{},"Read at the Masonic Temple, Boston,

December 2, 1841

The times, as we say -- or the present aspects of our social state, the Laws, Divinity, Natural Science, Agriculture, Art, Trade, Letters, have their root in an invisible spiritual reality. To appear in these aspects, they must first exist, or have some necessary foundation. Beside all the small reasons we assign, there is a great reason for the existence of every extant fact; a reason which lies grand and immovable, often unsuspected behind it in silence. The Times are the masquerade of the eternities; trivial to the dull, tokens of noble and majestic agents to the wise; the receptacle in which the Past leaves its history; the quarry out of which the genius of to-day is building up the Future. The Times -- the nations, manners, institutions, opinions, votes, are to be studied as omens, as sacred leaves, whereon a weighty sense is inscribed, if we have the wit and the love to search it out. Nature itself seems to propound to us this topic, and to invite us to explore the meaning of the conspicuous facts of the day. Everything that is popular, it has been said, deserves the attention of the philosopher: and this for the obvious reason, that although it may not be of any worth in itself, yet it characterizes the people.

Here is very good matter to be handled, if we are skilful; an abundance of important practical questions which it behoves us to understand. Let us examine the pretensions of the attacking and defending parties. Here is this great fact of Conservatism, entrenched in its immense redoubts, with Himmaleh for its front, and Atlas for its flank, and Andes for its rear, and the Atlantic and Pacific seas for its ditches and trenches, which has planted its crosses, and crescents, and stars and stripes, and various signs and badges of possession, over every rood of the planet, and says, `I will hold fast; and to whom I will, will I give; and whom I will, will I exclude and starve:' so says Conservatism; and all the children of men attack the colossus in their youth, and all, or all but a few, bow before it when they are old. A necessity not yet commanded, a negative imposed on the will of man by his condition a deficiency in his force, is the foundation on which it rests. Let this side be fairly stated. Meantime, on the other part, arises Reform, and offers the sentiment of Love as an overmatch to this material might. I wish to consider well this affirmative side, which has a loftier port and reason than heretofore, which encroaches on the other every day, puts it out of countenance, out of reason, and out of temper, and leaves it nothing but silence and possession.

The fact of aristocracy, with its two weapons of wealth and manners, is as commanding a feature of the nineteenth century, and the American republic, as of old Rome, or modern England. The reason and influence of wealth, the aspect of philosophy and religion, and the tendencies which have acquired the name of Transcendentalism in Old and New England; the aspect of poetry, as the exponent and interpretation of these things; the fuller development and the freer play of Character as a social and political agent; -- these and other related topics will in turn come to be considered.

But the subject of the Times is not an abstract question. We talk of the world, but we mean a few men and women. If you speak of the age, you mean your own platoon of people, as Milton and Dante painted in colossal their platoons, and called them Heaven and Hell. In our idea of progress, we do not go out of this personal picture. We do not think the sky will be bluer, or honey sweeter, or our climate more temperate, but only that our relation to our fellows will be simpler and happier. What is the reason to be given for this extreme attraction which _persons_ have for us, but that they are the Age? they are the results of the Past; they are the heralds of the Future. They indicate, -- these witty, suffering, blushing, intimidating figures of the only race in which there are individuals or changes, how far on the Fate has gone, and what it drives at. As trees make scenery, and constitute the hospitality of the landscape, so persons are the world to persons. A cunning mystery by which the Great Desart of thoughts and of planets takes this engaging form, to bring, as it would seem, its meanings nearer to the mind. Thoughts walk and speak, and look with eyes at me, and transport me into new and magnificent scenes. These are the pungent instructors who thrill the heart of each of us, and make all other teaching formal and cold. How I follow them with aching heart, with pining desire! I count myself nothing before them. I would die for them with joy. They can do what they will with me. How they lash us with those tongues! How they make the tears start, make us blush and turn pale, and lap us in Elysium to soothing dreams, and castles in the air! By tones of triumph; of dear love; by threats; by pride that freezes; these have the skill to make the world look bleak and inhospitable, or seem the nest of tenderness and joy. I do not wonder at the miracles which poetry attributes to the music of Orpheus, when I remember what I have experienced from the varied notes of the human voice. They are an incalculable energy which countervails all other forces in nature, because they are the channel of supernatural powers. There is no interest or institution so poor and withered, but if a new strong man could be born into it, he would immediately redeem and replace it. A personal ascendency, -- that is the only fact much worth considering. I remember, some years ago, somebody shocked a circle of friends of order here in Boston, who supposed that our people were identified with their religious denominations, by declaring that an eloquent man, -- let him be of what sect soever, -- would be ordained at once in one of our metropolitan churches. To be sure he would; and not only in ours, but in any church, mosque, or temple, on the planet; but he must be eloquent, able to supplant our method and classification, by the superior beauty of his own. Every fact we have was brought here by some person; and there is none that will not change and pass away before a person, whose nature is broader than the person which the fact in question represents. And so I find the Age walking about in happy and hopeful natures, in strong eyes, and pleasant thoughts, and think I read it nearer and truer so, than in the statute-book, or in the investments of capital, which rather celebrate with mournful music the obsequies of the last age. In the brain of a fanatic; in the wild hope of a mountain boy, called by city boys very ignorant, because they do not know what his hope has certainly apprised him shall be; in the love-glance of a girl; in the hair-splitting conscientiousness of some eccentric person, who has found some new scruple to embarrass himself and his neighbors withal; is to be found that which shall constitute the times to come, more than in the now organized and accredited oracles. For, whatever is affirmative and now advancing, contains it. I think that only is real, which men love and rejoice in; not what they tolerate, but what they choose; what they embrace and avow, and not the things which chill, benumb, and terrify them.

And so why not draw for these times a portrait gallery? Let us paint the painters. Whilst the Daguerreotypist, with camera-obscura and silver plate, begins now to traverse the land, let us set up our Camera also, and let the sun paint the people. Let us paint the agitator, and the man of the old school, and the member of Congress, and the college-professor, the formidable editor, the priest, and reformer, the contemplative girl, and the fair aspirant for fashion and opportunities, the woman of the world who has tried and knows; --let us examine how well she knows. Could we indicate the indicators, indicate those who most accurately represent every good and evil tendency of the general mind, in the just order which they take on this canvass of Time; so that all witnesses should recognise a spiritual law, as each well known form flitted for a moment across the wall, we should have a series of sketches which would report to the next ages the color and quality of ours.

Certainly, I think, if this were done, there would be much to admire as well as to condemn; souls of as lofty a port, as any in Greek or Roman fame, might appear; men of great heart, of strong hand, and of persuasive speech; subtle thinkers, and men of wide sympathy, and an apprehension which looks over all history, and everywhere recognises its own. To be sure, there will be fragments and hints of men, more than enough: bloated promises, which end in nothing or little. And then truly great men, but with some defect in their composition, which neutralizes their whole force. Here is a Damascus blade, such as you may search through nature in vain to parallel, laid up on the shelf in some village to rust and ruin. And how many seem not quite available for that idea which they represent! Now and then comes a bolder spirit, I should rather say, a more surrendered soul, more informed and led by God, which is much in advance of the rest, quite beyond their sympathy, but predicts what shall soon be the general fulness; as when we stand by the seashore, whilst the tide is coming in, a wave comes up the beach far higher than any foregoing one, and recedes; and for a long while none comes up to that mark; but after some time the whole sea is there and beyond it.

But we are not permitted to stand as spectators of the pageant which the times exhibit: we are parties also, and have a responsibility which is not to be declined. A little while this interval of wonder and comparison is permitted us, but to the end that we shall play a manly part. As the solar system moves forward in the heavens, certain stars open before us, and certain stars close up behind us; so is man's life. The reputations that were great and inaccessible change and tarnish. How great were once Lord Bacon's dimensions! he is now reduced almost to the middle height; and many another star has turned out to be a planet or an asteroid: only a few are the fixed stars which have no parallax, or none for us. The change and decline of old reputations are the gracious marks of our own growth. Slowly, like light of morning, it steals on us, the new fact, that we, who were pupils or aspirants, are now society: do compose a portion of that head and heart we are won't to think worthy of all reverence and heed. We are the representatives of religion and intellect, and stand in the light of Ideas, whose rays stream through us to those younger and more in the dark. What further relations we sustain, what new lodges we are entering, is now unknown. To-day is a king in disguise. To-day always looks mean to the thoughtless, in the face of an uniform experience, that all good and great and happy actions are made up precisely of these blank to-days. Let us not be so deceived. Let us unmask the king as he passes. Let us not inhabit times of wonderful and various promise without divining their tendency. Let us not see the foundations of nations, and of a new and better order of things laid, with roving eyes, and an attention preoccupied with trifles.

The two omnipresent parties of History, the party of the Past and the party of the Future, divide society to-day as of old. Here is the innumerable multitude of those who accept the state and the church from the last generation, and stand on no argument but possession. They have reason also, and, as I think, better reason than is commonly stated. No Burke, no Metternich has yet done full justice to the side of conservatism. But this class, however large, relying not on the intellect but on instinct, blends itself with the brute forces of nature, is respectable only as nature is, but the individuals have no attraction for us. It is the dissenter, the theorist, the aspirant, who is quitting this ancient domain to embark on seas of adventure, who engages our interest. Omitting then for the present all notice of the stationary class, we shall find that the movement party divides itself into two classes, the actors, and the students.

The actors constitute that great army of martyrs who, at least in America, by their conscience and philanthropy, occupy the ground which Calvinism occupied in the last age, and compose the visible church of the existing generation. The present age will be marked by its harvest of projects for the reform of domestic, civil, literary, and ecclesiastical institutions. The leaders of the crusades against War, Negro slavery, Intemperance, Government based on force, Usages of trade, Court and Custom-house Oaths, and so on to the agitators on the system of Education and the laws of Property, are the right successors of Luther, Knox, Robinson, Fox, Penn, Wesley, and Whitfield. They have the same virtues and vices; the same noble impulse, and the same bigotry. These movements are on all accounts important; they not only check the special abuses, but they educate the conscience and the intellect of the people. How can such a question as the Slave trade be agitated for forty years by all the Christian nations, without throwing great light on ethics into the general mind? The fury, with which the slave-trader defends every inch of his bloody deck, and his howling auction-platform, is a trumpet to alarm the ear of mankind, to wake the dull, and drive all neutrals to take sides, and to listen to the argument and the verdict. The Temperance-question, which rides the conversation of ten thousand circles, and is tacitly recalled at every public and at every private table, drawing with it all the curious ethics of the Pledge, of the Wine-question, of the equity of the manufacture and the trade, is a gymnastic training to the casuistry and conscience of the time. Antimasonry had a deep right and wrong, which gradually emerged to sight out of the turbid controversy. The political questions touching the Banks; the Tariff; the limits of the executive power; the right of the constituent to instruct the representative; the treatment of the Indians; the Boundary wars; the Congress of nations; are all pregnant with ethical conclusions; and it is well if government and our social order can extricate themselves from these alembics, and find themselves still government and social order. The student of history will hereafter compute the singular value of our endless discussion of questions, to the mind of the period.
Whilst each of these aspirations and attempts of the people for the Better is magnified by the natural exaggeration of its advocates, until it excludes the others from sight, and repels discreet persons by the unfairness of the plea, the movements are in reality all parts of one movement. There is a perfect chain, -- see it, or see it not, -- of reforms emerging from the surrounding darkness, each cherishing some part of the general idea, and all must be seen, in order to do justice to any one. Seen in this their natural connection, they are sublime. The conscience of the Age demonstrates itself in this effort to raise the life of man by putting it in harmony with his idea of the Beautiful and the Just. The history of reform is always identical; it is the comparison of the idea with the fact. Our modes of living are not agreeable to our imagination. We suspect they are unworthy. We arraign our daily employments. They appear to us unfit, unworthy of the faculties we spend on them. In conversation with a wise man, we find ourselves apologizing for our employments; we speak of them with shame. Nature, literature, science, childhood, appear to us beautiful; but not our own daily work, not the ripe fruit and considered labors of man. This beauty which the fancy finds in everything else, certainly accuses that manner of life we lead. Why should it be hateful? Why should it contrast thus with all natural beauty? Why should it not be poetic, and invite and raise us? Is there a necessity that the works of man should be sordid? Perhaps not. -- Out of this fair Idea in the mind springs the effort at the Perfect. It is the interior testimony to a fairer possibility of life and manners, which agitates society every day with the offer of some new amendment. If we would make more strict inquiry concerning its origin, we find ourselves rapidly approaching the inner boundaries of thought, that term where speech becomes silence, and science conscience. For the origin of all reform is in that mysterious fountain of the moral sentiment in man, which, amidst the natural, ever contains the supernatural for men. That is new and creative. That is alive. That alone can make a man other than he is. Here or nowhere resides unbounded energy, unbounded power.

The new voices in the wilderness crying ""Repent,"" have revived a hope, which had well nigh perished out of the world, that the thoughts of the mind may yet, in some distant age, in some happy hour, be executed by the hands. That is the hope, of which all other hopes are parts. For some ages, these ideas have been consigned to the poet and musical composer, to the prayers and the sermons of churches; but the thought, that they can ever have any footing in real life, seems long since to have been exploded by all judicious persons. Milton, in his best tract, describes a relation between religion and the daily occupations, which is true until this time.

""A wealthy man, addicted to his pleasure and to his profits, finds religion to be a traffic so entangled, and of so many piddling accounts, that of all mysteries he cannot skill to keep a stock going upon that trade. What should he do? Fain he would have the name to be religious; fain he would bear up with his neighbors in that. What does he, therefore, but resolve to give over toiling, and to find himself out some factor, to whose care and credit he may commit the whole managing of his religious affairs; some divine of note and estimation that must be. To him he adheres, resigns the whole warehouse of his religion, with all the locks and keys, into his custody; and indeed makes the very person of that man his religion; esteems his associating with him a sufficient evidence and commendatory of his own piety. So that a man may say, his religion is now no more within himself, but is become a dividual moveable, and goes and comes near him, according as that good man frequents the house. He entertains him, gives him gifts, feasts him, lodges him; his religion comes home at night, prays, is liberally supped, and sumptuously laid to sleep, rises, is saluted, and after the malmsey, or some well spiced beverage, and better breakfasted than he whose morning appetite would have gladly fed on green figs between Bethany and Jerusalem, his religion walks abroad at eight, and leaves his kind entertainer in the shop, trading all day without his religion.""

This picture would serve for our times. Religion was not invited to eat or drink or sleep with us, or to make or divide an estate, but was a holiday guest. Such omissions judge the church; as the compromise made with the slaveholder, not much noticed at first, every day appears more flagrant mischief to the American constitution. But now the purists are looking into all these matters. The more intelligent are growing uneasy on the subject of Marriage. They wish to see the character represented also in that covenant. There shall be nothing brutal in it, but it shall honor the man and the woman, as much as the most diffusive and universal action. Grimly the same spirit looks into the law of Property, and accuses men of driving a trade in the great boundless providence which had given the air, the water, and the land to men, to use and not to fence in and monopolize. It casts its eye on Trade, and Day Labor, and so it goes up and down, paving the earth with eyes, destroying privacy, and making thorough-lights. Is all this for nothing? Do you suppose that the reforms, which are preparing, will be as superficial as those we know?

By the books it reads and translates, judge what books it will presently print. A great deal of the profoundest thinking of antiquity, which had become as good as obsolete for us, is now re-appearing in extracts and allusions, and in twenty years will get all printed anew. See how daring is the reading, the speculation, the experimenting of the time. If now some genius shall arise who could unite these scattered rays! And always such a genius does embody the ideas of each time. Here is great variety and richness of mysticism, each part of which now only disgusts, whilst it forms the sole thought of some poor Perfectionist or ""Comer out,"" yet, when it shall be taken up as the garniture of some profound and all-reconciling thinker, will appear the rich and appropriate decoration of his robes.

These reforms are our contemporaries; they are ourselves; our own light, and sight, and conscience; they only name the relation which subsists between us and the vicious institutions which they go to rectify. They are the simplest statements of man in these matters; the plain right and wrong. I cannot choose but allow and honor them. The impulse is good, and the theory; the practice is less beautiful. The Reformers affirm the inward life, but they do not trust it, but use outward and vulgar means. They do not rely on precisely that strength which wins me to their cause; not on love, not on a principle, but on men, on multitudes, on circumstances, on money, on party; that is, on fear, on wrath, and pride. The love which lifted men to the sight of these better ends, was the true and best distinction of this time, the disposition to trust a principle more than a material force. I think _that_ the soul of reform; the conviction, that not sensualism, not slavery, not war, not imprisonment, not even government, are needed, -- but in lieu of them all, reliance on the sentiment of man, which will work best the more it is trusted; not reliance on numbers, but, contrariwise, distrust of numbers, and the feeling that then are we strongest, when most private and alone. The young men, who have been vexing society for these last years with regenerative methods, seem to have made this mistake; they all exaggerated some special means, and all failed to see that the Reform of Reforms must be accomplished without means.

The Reforms have their high origin in an ideal justice, but they do not retain the purity of an idea. They are quickly organized in some low, inadequate form, and present no more poetic image to the mind, than the evil tradition which they reprobated. They mix the fire of the moral sentiment with personal and party heats, with measureless exaggerations, and the blindness that prefers some darling measure to justice and truth. Those, who are urging with most ardor what are called the greatest benefits of mankind, are narrow, self-pleasing, conceited men, and affect us as the insane do. They bite us, and we run mad also. I think the work of the reformer as innocent as other work that is done around him; but when I have seen it near, I do not like it better. It is done in the same way, it is done profanely, not piously; by management, by tactics, and clamor. It is a buzz in the ear. I cannot feel any pleasure in sacrifices which display to me such partiality of character. We do not want actions, but men; not a chemical drop of water, but rain; the spirit that sheds and showers actions, countless, endless actions. You have on some occasion played a bold part. You have set your heart and face against society, when you thought it wrong, and returned it frown for frown. Excellent: now can you afford to forget it, reckoning all your action no more than the passing of your hand through the air, or a little breath of your mouth? The world leaves no track in space, and the greatest action of man no mark in the vast idea. To the youth diffident of his ability, and full of compunction at his unprofitable existence, the temptation is always great to lend himself to public movements, and as one of a party accomplish what he cannot hope to effect alone. But he must resist the degradation of a man to a measure. I must act with truth, though I should never come to act, as you call it, with effect. I must consent to inaction. A patience which is grand; a brave and cold neglect of the offices which prudence exacts, so it be done in a deep, upper piety; a consent to solitude and inaction, which proceeds out of an unwillingness to violate character, is the century which makes the gem. Whilst therefore I desire to express the respect and joy I feel before this sublime connection of reforms, now in their infancy around us, I urge the more earnestly the paramount duties of self-reliance. I cannot find language of sufficient energy to convey my sense of the sacredness of private integrity. All men, all things, the state, the church, yea the friends of the heart are phantasms and unreal beside the sanctuary of the heart. With so much awe, with so much fear, let it be respected.

The great majority of men, unable to judge of any principle until its light falls on a fact, are not aware of the evil that is around them, until they see it in some gross form, as in a class of intemperate men, or slaveholders, or soldiers, or fraudulent persons. Then they are greatly moved; and magnifying the importance of that wrong, they fancy that if that abuse were redressed, all would go well, and they fill the land with clamor to correct it. Hence the missionary and other religious efforts. If every island and every house had a Bible, if every child was brought into the Sunday School, would the wounds of the world heal, and man be upright?

But the man of ideas, accounting the circumstance nothing, judges of the commonwealth from the state of his own mind. `If,' he says, `I am selfish, then is there slavery, or the effort to establish it, wherever I go. But if I am just, then is there no slavery, let the laws say what they will. For if I treat all men as gods, how to me can there be such a thing as a slave?' But how frivolous is your war against circumstances. This denouncing philanthropist is himself a slaveholder in every word and look. Does he free me? Does he cheer me? He is the state of Georgia, or Alabama, with their sanguinary slave-laws walking here on our north-eastern shores. We are all thankful he has no more political power, as we are fond of liberty ourselves. I am afraid our virtue is a little geographical. I am not mortified by our vice; that is obduracy; it colors and palters, it curses and swears, and I can see to the end of it; but, I own, our virtue makes me ashamed; so sour and narrow, so thin and blind, virtue so vice-like. Then again, how trivial seem the contests of the abolitionist, whilst he aims merely at the circumstance of the slave. Give the slave the least elevation of religious sentiment, and he is no slave: you are the slave: he not only in his humility feels his superiority, feels that much deplored condition of his to be a fading trifle, but he makes you feel it too. He is the master. The exaggeration, which our young people make of his wrongs, characterizes themselves. What are no trifles to them, they naturally think are no trifles to Pompey.

We say, then, that the reforming movement is sacred in its origin; in its management and details timid and profane. These benefactors hope to raise man by improving his circumstances: by combination of that which is dead, they hope to make something alive. In vain. By new infusions alone of the spirit by which he is made and directed, can he be re-made and reinforced. The sad Pestalozzi, who shared with all ardent spirits the hope of Europe on the outbreak of the French Revolution, after witnessing its sequel, recorded his conviction, that ""the amelioration of outward circumstances will be the effect, but can never be the means of mental and moral improvement."" Quitting now the class of actors, let us turn to see how it stands with the other class of which we spoke, namely, the students.

A new disease has fallen on the life of man. Every Age, like every human body, has its own distemper. Other times have had war, or famine, or a barbarism domestic or bordering, as their antagonism. Our forefathers walked in the world and went to their graves, tormented with the fear of Sin, and the terror of the Day of Judgment. These terrors have lost their force, and our torment is Unbelief, the Uncertainty as to what we ought to do; the distrust of the value of what we do, and the distrust that the Necessity (which we all at last believe in) is fair and beneficent. Our Religion assumes the negative form of rejection. Out of love of the true, we repudiate the false: and the Religion is an abolishing criticism. A great perplexity hangs like a cloud on the brow of all cultivated persons, a certain imbecility in the best spirits, which distinguishes the period. We do not find the same trait in the Arabian, in the Hebrew, in Greek, Roman, Norman, English periods; no, but in other men a natural firmness. The men did not see beyond the need of the hour. They planted their foot strong, and doubted nothing. We mistrust every step we take. We find it the worst thing about time, that we know not what to do with it. We are so sharp-sighted that we can neither work nor think, neither read Plato nor not read him.

Then there is what is called a too intellectual tendency. Can there be too much intellect? We have never met with any such excess. But the criticism, which is levelled at the laws and manners, ends in thought, without causing a new method of life. The genius of the day does not incline to a deed, but to a beholding. It is not that men do not wish to act; they pine to be employed, but are paralyzed by the uncertainty what they should do. The inadequacy of the work to the faculties, is the painful perception which keeps them still. This happens to the best. Then, talents bring their usual temptations, and the current literature and poetry with perverse ingenuity draw us away from life to solitude and meditation. This could well be borne, if it were great and involuntary; if the men were ravished by their thought, and hurried into ascetic extravagances. Society could then manage to release their shoulder from its wheel, and grant them for a time this privilege of sabbath. But they are not so. Thinking, which was a rage, is become an art. The thinker gives me results, and never invites me to be present with him at his invocation of truth, and to enjoy with him its proceeding into his mind.

So little action amidst such audacious and yet sincere profession, that we begin to doubt if that great revolution in the art of war, which has made it a game of posts instead of a game of battles, has not operated on Reform; whether this be not also a war of posts, a paper blockade, in which each party is to display the utmost resources of his spirit and belief, and no conflict occur; but the world shall take that course which the demonstration of the truth shall indicate.
But we must pay for being too intellectual, as they call it. People are not as light-hearted for it. I think men never loved life less. I question if care and doubt ever wrote their names so legibly on the faces of any population. This _Ennui_, for which we Saxons had no name, this word of France has got a terrific significance. It shortens life, and bereaves the day of its light. Old age begins in the nursery, and before the young American is put into jacket and trowsers, he says, `I want something which I never saw before;' and `I wish I was not I.' I have seen the same gloom on the brow even of those adventurers from the intellectual class, who had dived deepest and with most success into active life. I have seen the authentic sign of anxiety and perplexity on the greatest forehead of the state. The canker worms have crawled to the topmost bough of the wild elm, and swing down from that. Is there less oxygen in the atmosphere? What has checked in this age the animal spirits which gave to our forefathers their bounding pulse?

But have a little patience with this melancholy humor. Their unbelief arises out of a greater Belief; their inaction out of a scorn of inadequate action. By the side of these men, the hot agitators have a certain cheap and ridiculous air; they even look smaller than the others. Of the two, I own, I like the speculators best. They have some piety which looks with faith to a fair Future, unprofaned by rash and unequal attempts to realize it. And truly we shall find much to console us, when we consider the cause of their uneasiness. It is the love of greatness, it is the need of harmony, the contrast of the dwarfish Actual with the exorbitant Idea. No man can compare the ideas and aspirations of the innovators of the present day, with those of former periods, without feeling how great and high this criticism is. The revolutions that impend over society are not now from ambition and rapacity, from impatience of one or another form of government, but from new modes of thinking, which shall recompose society after a new order, which shall animate labor by love and science, which shall destroy the value of many kinds of property, and replace all property within the dominion of reason and equity. There was never so great a thought laboring in the breasts of men, as now. It almost seems as if what was aforetime spoken fabulously and hieroglyphically, was now spoken plainly, the doctrine, namely, of the indwelling of the Creator in man. The spiritualist wishes this only, that the spiritual principle should be suffered to demonstrate itself to the end, in all possible applications to the state of man, without the admission of anything unspiritual, that is, anything positive, dogmatic, or personal. The excellence of this class consists in this, that they have believed; that, affirming the need of new and higher modes of living and action, they have abstained from the recommendation of low methods. Their fault is that they have stopped at the intellectual perception; that their will is not yet inspired from the Fountain of Love. But whose fault is this? and what a fault, and to what inquiry does it lead! We have come to that which is the spring of all power, of beauty and virtue, of art and poetry; and who shall tell us according to what law its inspirations and its informations are given or withholden?

I do not wish to be guilty of the narrowness and pedantry of inferring the tendency and genius of the Age from a few and insufficient facts or persons. Every age has a thousand sides and signs and tendencies; and it is only when surveyed from inferior points of view, that great varieties of character appear. Our time too is full of activity and performance. Is there not something comprehensive in the grasp of a society which to great mechanical invention, and the best institutions of property, adds the most daring theories; which explores the subtlest and most universal problems? At the manifest risk of repeating what every other Age has thought of itself, we might say, we think the Genius of this Age more philosophical than any other has been, righter in its aims, truer, with less fear, less fable, less mixture of any sort.

But turn it how we will, as we ponder this meaning of the times, every new thought drives us to the deep fact, that the Time is the child of the Eternity. The main interest which any aspects of the Times can have for us, is the great spirit which gazes through them, the light which they can shed on the wonderful questions, What we are? and Whither we tend? We do not wish to be deceived. Here we drift, like white sail across the wild ocean, now bright on the wave, now darkling in the trough of the sea; -- but from what port did we sail? Who knows? Or to what port are we bound? Who knows? There is no one to tell us but such poor weather-tossed mariners as ourselves, whom we speak as we pass, or who have hoisted some signal, or floated to us some letter in a bottle from far. But what know they more than we? They also found themselves on this wondrous sea. No; from the older sailors, nothing. Over all their speaking-trumpets, the gray sea and the loud winds answer, Not in us; not in Time. Where then but in Ourselves, where but in that Thought through which we communicate with absolute nature, and are made aware that, whilst we shed the dust of which we are built, grain by grain, till it is all gone, the law which clothes us with humanity remains new? where, but in the intuitions which are vouchsafed us from within, shall we learn the Truth? Faithless, faithless, we fancy that with the dust we depart and are not; and do not know that the law and the perception of the law are at last one; that only as much as the law enters us, becomes us, we are living men, -- immortal with the immortality of this law. Underneath all these appearances, lies that which is, that which lives, that which causes. This ever renewing generation of appearances rests on a reality, and a reality that is alive.

To a true scholar the attraction of the aspects of nature, the departments of life, and the passages of his experience, is simply the information they yield him of this supreme nature which lurks within all. That reality, that causing force is moral. The Moral Sentiment is but its other name. It makes by its presence or absence right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, genius or depravation. As the granite comes to the surface, and towers into the highest mountains, and, if we dig down, we find it below the superficial strata, so in all the details of our domestic or civil life, is hidden the elemental reality, which ever and anon comes to the surface, and forms the grand men, who are the leaders and examples, rather than the companions of the race. The granite is curiously concealed under a thousand formations and surfaces, under fertile soils, and grasses, and flowers, under well-manured, arable fields, and large towns and cities, but it makes the foundation of these, and is always indicating its presence by slight but sure signs. So is it with the Life of our life; so close does that also hide. I read it in glad and in weeping eyes: I read it in the pride and in the humility of people: it is recognized in every bargain and in every complaisance, in every criticism, and in all praise: it is voted for at elections; it wins the cause with juries; it rides the stormy eloquence of the senate, sole victor; histories are written of it, holidays decreed to it; statues, tombs, churches, built to its honor; yet men seem to fear and to shun it, when it comes barely to view in our immediate neighborhood.

For that reality let us stand: that let us serve, and for that speak. Only as far as _that_ shines through them, are these times or any times worth consideration. I wish to speak of the politics, education, business, and religion around us, without ceremony or false deference. You will absolve me from the charge of flippancy, or malignity, or the desire to say smart things at the expense of whomsoever, when you see that reality is all we prize, and that we are bound on our entrance into nature to speak for that. Let it not be recorded in our own memories, that in this moment of the Eternity, when we who were named by our names, flitted across the light, we were afraid of any fact, or disgraced the fair Day by a pusillanimous preference of our bread to our freedom. What is the scholar, what is the man _for_, but for hospitality to every new thought of his time? Have you leisure, power, property, friends? you shall be the asylum and patron of every new thought, every unproven opinion, every untried project, which proceeds out of good will and honest seeking. All the newspapers, all the tongues of to-day will of course at first defame what is noble; but you who hold not of to-day, not of the times, but of the Everlasting, are to stand for it: and the highest compliment man ever receives from heaven, is the sending to him its disguised and discredited angels.",223434,en,en,en

Six Ballads About King Arthur - The Birth of King Arthur,misc,Anonymous,2016,33,{},"MY DEAR CHILDREN

I strung the following lines together hoping to give you pleasure. The stories are taken from a book called 'Morte d'Arthur' which you will read when you are older, and will see that I have often used the very words of the translator

YOUR LOVING GRANNY

THE BIRTH OF KING ARTHUR.

'To horse! to horse! my noble lord,'
Thus spake the fair Igraine,
'Ride hard -- ride fast all through the night,
Nor stay, nor slack the rein.'

'Now why such haste to leave the Court?'
The Duke of Cornwall cried.
'Ah me,' she said, 'King Uther wills
Thy wife should be his bride.'

Fast, fast they rode all through the night,
Nor stayed, nor slacked the rein,
Until the towers of Tintagel
Rose shining o'er the plain.
But on the morrow, messengers
Came riding from the King:
'Uther Pendragon bids the Duke
Himself and wife to bring

Back to fair London town.' -- 'Unto
The King this answer give:
Nor self nor wife shall tread his halls
So long as either live.'

Then sware the King a dreadful oath,
Or ere the fortieth day
He would unearth him from his lair,
And waste, and burn, and slay.

Alack for right 'gainst regal might!
It boots but ill to tell
How in a sally 'gainst the King
The brave Duke Cornwall fell.

The towers he manned, the wife he loved,
Became King Uther's prey,
And from her home at Tintagel
Igraine was borne away.

And when her baby boy was born,
In cloth of gold with state
'Twas given to a beggar-man,
Who waited at the gate.
But this was Merlin, in disguise
Of beggar old and grey,
The great enchanter, Merlin hight,
Who bore the babe away

Unto a holy, saintly man,
Who christened him by name
Of Arthur -- prince of chivalry,
First on the scroll of fame.

And good Sir Ector's noble wife
Nurtured the baby fair,
And brought him up in gentle ways,
Befitting England's heir.

Eftsoons King Uther sickenèd
And fell in woful plight;
He spake to non or great or small,
By day nor eke by night.

Then Merlin rose in council full,
And spake both loud and high:
'God's will be done, but I will make
Him speak or ere he die!'

So in hot haste, without delay,
Unto the King he hied,
Knelt down beside the royal couch:
'Wilt thou, O Sire,' he cried
'That Arthur, thy own son, shall rule
O'er England in thy stead?'
The noble vassals gathered round,
Listening astonishèd.

For naught knew they of infant son,
But every Baron there
Mighty of men, and strong of arm,
Wended to be the heir.

King Uther Pendragon turned round
Upon his dying bed,
And to the knights assembled there
And to great Merlin said:

'May God Almighty bless my son!
I, too, my blessing give;
Bid him use fitting holy prayers
That my poor soul may live:

'And claim the crown right worshipful
On pain of blessing lost.'
With that he turned him o'er again,
And yielded up the ghost.

They buried him with regal pomp,
While all his Barons wept,
As did Igraine, his beauteous queen --
But Uther calmly slept.",2853571,en,en,en
Words for Hart Crane,misc,Robert Lowell,1959,26,{},"""When the Pulitzers showered on some dope

Because I knew my Whitman like a book,
stranger in America, tell my country: I,
Catullus redivivus, once the rage
of the Village and Paris, used to play my role
of homosexual, wolfing the stray lambs
who hungered by the Place de la Concorde.
My profit was a pocket with a hole.
Who asks for me, the Shelley of my age,
must lay his heart out for my bed and board.""",2316155,en,en,en

Or the darkness you see?
Is it the way that I breathe, or the way that I speak?
The colors I like, or the fact I weep?
Uh

Am I gay, or am i straight?
Feeling fat? Lose some weight
Feeling sad? Don't explain
Real niggas play sports
Bitch niggas stay home

Grow your hair, don't comb
Cut your hair, be grown

In this world that you own, you sit upon a throne
Make products like perfume but label it cologne
I can tell you're just as fragile, maybe even more
Masculinity at risk, so you barricade the door
[Chorus]
I guess I'll call it Tumblr

[Verse 2]
Why can't a lady just fuck without you saying what's what?
Why can't she go outside without a comment passed by?
Why she gotta work hard, when I barely do my job?
I call it same wage, she call it getting robbed

How many women will it take, till rapists catch a case?
How many women will you shame, if they body changes shape?
Can a single mother live, or will she struggle everyday?

Messages I relay, still relevant today
Think about how far we came yet masters still enslave

Beating women to a grave
While rocking type shirts with the same name
Guess it's glorified, horay

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Before they brought me in
Was whispering through trembling lips
""Take a message to my kin""

After that the only
Recollection I have
Is tracing with my fingertips
A faded photograph

I was out on the Black Atlantic
Clinging to the mast
(Sails tattered on the mast)
Praying on the windswept deck
That this ship is built to last
Calling, Crying, Shouting out your name

They say that once you've been there
You are never quite the same
My nerves are shot to pieces
I've been waiting here in vain
A ghost got in the looking glass
Who is that I see?
A shock of recognition
That poor lost soul is me

Since that night out on the sea
No keepsakes do I have
Just the thought, the dream of you
And a salt-stained photograph

Now I walk these paper streets
And all the buildings sway
The tides that shift beneath my feet
Are going to carry me away",1089590,en,en,en

Flying diet form, with new age music on vinyl for the quiet storm
Methods and techniques and symmetrical forces
Full of i need a few more electrical sources

Lass die Erde beben//
Du musst für die Zukunft streben//

Deswegen sollte man jede freie Minute nutzen//
Und nicht im Bett rumliegen für Paar Stunden//
Man kann so vieles machen//
Mit vielen Leuten lachen//
Man kann so viele Sachen erledigen//
Das kann man nur bestätigen//

Ganz egal ob es auch morgen passiert//

Another day, she sets foot in this prison
Dreading what they'll say
So much to give, but no one ever listens
She dreams of running away
Crippled by the way they make her feel
She takes a look at her wrists and turns to the blade
It's not a cry for attention if she just wants to feel
Anything other than the pain

[Hook]
Everyone deserves to be loved
But they make her hate everything she was sure of
Every day feels like her against the world
Now she's afraid she'll never be enough

[Chorus]
No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone
The memories, they haunt her
No one sees all the pain she brings everywhere she goes
She feels they'll never want her
[Post-Chorus]
She dreams of a day when she won't have to cry herself to sleep
Staring at the scars on her wrists
She knows this is not who she wants to be

[Verse 2]
Another night, all alone with her thoughts
Dwelling on the questions that race through her head
Scared to sleep, scared to wake up and face the day
When she can't forget the things that they said

[Chorus]
No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone
(The memories, they haunt her)
No one sees all the pain she brings everywhere she goes
(She feels they'll never want her)
All she wants is someone to notice
(So sick of feeling invisible)
All she needs is someone to care
(If only they could see that she's incredible)

[Post-Chorus]
She dreams of a day when she won't have to cry herself to sleep
Is our generation too blind to see true beauty lies beneath the skin?
So ignorant

Are they too cold, too numb
To see the lifelong effects of the pain they inflict?
(Of the pain they inflict)
Is our generation too blind to see true beauty lies beneath the skin?
(Beneath the skin!)

No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone

The Last of the Mohicans Chap. 5,misc,James Fenimore Cooper,2013,31,{},"         ""In such a night
         Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew;
         And saw the lion's shadow ere himself.""

         Merchant of Venice.

The suddenness of the flight of his guide, and the wild cries of the pursuers, caused Heyward to remain fixed, for a few moments, in inactive surprise. Then recollecting the importance of securing the fugitive, he dashed aside the surrounding bushes, and pressed eagerly forward to lend his aid in the chase. Before he had, however, proceeded a hundred yards, he met the three foresters already returning from their unsuccessful pursuit.

""Why so soon disheartened!"" he exclaimed; ""the scoundrel must be concealed behind some of these trees, and may yet be secured. We are not safe while he goes at large.""

""Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?""  returned the disappointed scout; ""I heard the imp, brushing over the dry leaves, like a black snake, and blinking a glimpse of him, just over ag'in yon big pine, I pulled as it might be on the scent; but 'twouldn't do! and yet for a reasoning aim, if anybody but myself had touched the trigger, I should call it a quick sight; and I may be accounted to have experience in these matters, and one who ought to know. Look at this sumach; its leaves are red, though everybody knows the fruit is in the yellow blossom, in the month of July!""

""'Tis the blood of Le Subtil! he is hurt, and may yet fall!""

""No, no,"" returned the scout, in decided disapprobation of this opinion,  ""I rubbed the bark off a limb, perhaps, but the creature leaped the longer for it. A rifle-bullet acts on a running animal, when it barks him, much the same as one of your spurs on a horse; that is, it quickens motion, and puts life into the flesh, instead of taking it away. But when it cuts the ragged hole, after a bound or two, there is, commonly, a stagnation of further leaping, be it Indian or be it deer!""

""We are four able bodies, to one wounded man!""

""Is life grievous to you?"" interrupted the scout. ""Yonder red devils would draw you within swing of the tomahawks of his comrades, before you were heated in the chase. It was an unthoughtful act in a man who has so often slept with the war-whoop ringing in the air, to let off his piece within sound of an ambushment! But then it was a natural temptation! 'twas very natural! Come, friends, let us move our station, and in such a fashion, too, as will throw the cunning of a Mingo on a wrong scent, or our scalps will be drying in the wind in front of Montcalm's marquee, ag'in this hour to-morrow.""

This appalling declaration, which the scout uttered with the cool assurance of a man who fully comprehended, while he did not fear to face the danger, served to remind Heyward of the importance of the charge with which he himself had been intrusted. Glancing his eyes around, with a vain effort to pierce the gloom that was thickening beneath the leafy arches of the forest, he felt as if, cut off from human aid, his unresisting companions would soon lie at the entire mercy of those barbarous enemies, who, like beasts of prey, only waited till the gathering darkness might render their blows more fatally certain. His awakened imagination, deluded by the deceptive light, converted each waving bush, or the fragment of some fallen tree, into human forms, and twenty times he fancied he could distinguish the horrid visages of his lurking foes, peering from their hiding-places, in never-ceasing watchfulness of the movements of his party. Looking upward, he found that the thin fleecy clouds, which evening had painted on the blue sky, were already losing their faintest tints of rose-color, while the imbedded stream, which glided past the spot where he stood, was to be traced only by the dark boundary of its wooded banks.
""What is to be done?""  he said, feeling the utter helplessness of doubt in such a pressing strait; ""desert me not, for God's sake! remain to defend those I escort, and freely name your own reward!""

His companions, who conversed apart in the language of their tribe, heeded not this sudden and earnest appeal. Though their dialogue was maintained in low and cautious sounds, but little above a whisper, Heyward, who now approached, could easily distinguish the earnest tones of the younger warrior from the more deliberate speeches of his seniors. It was evident that they debated on the propriety of some measure that nearly concerned the welfare of the travellers. Yielding to his powerful interest in the subject, and impatient of a delay that seemed fraught with so much additional danger, Heyward drew still nigher to the dusky group, with an intention of making his offers of compensation more definite, when the white man, motioning, with his hand, as if he conceded the disputed point, turned away, saying in a sort of soliloquy, and in the English tongue,—

""Uncas is right! it would not be the act of men to leave such harmless things to their fate, even though it breaks up the harboring place forever. If you would save these tender blossoms from the fangs of the worst of serpents, gentleman, you have neither time to lose nor resolution to throw away!""

""How can such a wish be doubted! have I not already offered—""

""Offer your prayers to Him who can give us wisdom to circumvent the cunning of the devils who fill these woods,"" calmly interrupted the scout, ""but spare your offers of money, which neither you may live to realize, nor I to profit by. These Mohicans and I will do what man's thoughts can invent, to keep such flowers, which, though so sweet, were never made for the wilderness, from harm, and that without hope of any other recompense but such as God always gives to upright dealings. First, you must promise two things, both in your own name and for your friends, or without serving you, we shall only injure ourselves!""

""Name them.""

""The one is, to be still as these sleeping woods, let what will happen; and the other is, to keep the place where we shall take you, forever a secret from all mortal men.""

""I will do my utmost to see both these conditions fulfilled.""

""Then follow, for we are losing moments that are as precious as the heart's blood to a stricken deer!""

Heyward could distinguish the impatient gesture of the scout, through the increasing shadows of the evening, and he moved in his footsteps, swiftly, towards the place where he had left the remainder of his party. When they rejoined the expecting and anxious females, he briefly acquainted them with the conditions of their new guide, and with the necessity that existed for their hushing every apprehension, in instant and serious exertions. Although his alarming communication was not received without much secret terror by the listeners, his earnest and impressive manner, aided perhaps by the nature of the danger, succeeded in bracing their nerves to undergo some unlooked-for and unusual trial. Silently, and without a moment's delay, they permitted him to assist them from their saddles, when they descended quickly to the water's edge, where the scout had collected the rest of the party, more by the agency of expressive gestures than by any use of words.

""What to do with these dumb creatures!""  muttered the white man, on whom the sole control of their future movements appeared to devolve;  ""it would be time lost to cut their throats, and cast them into the river; and to leave them here, would be to tell the Mingos that they have not far to seek to find their owners!""

""Then give them their bridles, and let them range the woods,"" Heyward ventured to suggest.

""No; it would be better to mislead the imps, and make them believe they must equal a horse's speed to run down their chase. Ay, ay, that will blind their fire-balls of eyes! Chingach—Hist? what stirs the bush?""
""The colt.""

""That colt, at least, must die,""  muttered the scout, grasping the mane of the nimble beast, which easily eluded his hand; ""Uncas, your arrows!""

""Hold!"" exclaimed the proprietor of the condemned animal, aloud, without regard to the whispering tones used by the others; ""spare the foal of Miriam! it is the comely offspring of a faithful dam, and would willingly injure naught.""

""When men struggle for the single life God has given them,""  said the scout sternly, ""even their own kind seem no more than the beasts of the wood. If you speak again, I shall leave you to the mercy of the Maquas! Draw to your arrow's head, Uncas; we have no time for second blows.""

The low, muttering sounds of his threatening voice were still audible, when the wounded foal, first rearing on its hinder legs, plunged forward to its knees. It was met by Chingachgook, whose knife passed across its throat quicker than thought, and then precipitating the motions of the struggling victim, he dashed it into the river, down whose stream it glided away, gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life. This deed of apparent cruelty, but of real necessity, fell upon the spirits of the travellers like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood, heightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of the actors in the scene. The sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other, while Heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had just drawn from their holsters, as he placed himself between his charge and those dense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before the bosom of the forest.

The Indians, however, hesitated not a moment, but taking the bridles, they led the frightened and reluctant horses into the bed of the river.

At a short distance from the shore they turned, and were soon concealed by the projection of the bank, under the brow of which they moved, in a direction opposite to the course of the waters. In the meantime, the scout drew a canoe of bark from its place of concealment beneath some low bushes, whose branches were waving with the eddies of the current, into which he silently motioned for the females to enter. They complied without hesitation, though many a fearful and anxious glance was thrown behind them towards the thickening gloom which now lay like a dark barrier along the margin of the stream.

So soon as Cora and Alice were seated, the scout, without regarding the element, directed Heyward to support one side of the frail vessel, and posting himself at the other, they bore it up against the stream, followed by the dejected owner of the dead foal. In this manner they proceeded, for many rods, in a silence that was only interrupted by the rippling of the water, as its eddies played around them, or the low dash made by their own cautious footsteps. Heyward yielded the guidance of the canoe implicitly to the scout, who approached or receded from the shore, to avoid the fragments of rocks, or deeper parts of the river, with a readiness that showed his knowledge of the route they held. Occasionally he would stop; and in the midst of a breathing stillness, that the dull but increasing roar of the waterfall only served to render more impressive, he would listen with painful intenseness, to catch any sounds that might arise from the slumbering forest. When assured that all was still, and unable to detect, even by the aid of his practised senses, any sign of his approaching foes, he would deliberately resume his slow and unguarded progress. At length they reached a point in the river, where the roving eye of Heyward became riveted on a cluster of black objects, collected at a spot where the high bank threw a deeper shadow than usual on the dark waters. Hesitating to advance, he pointed out the place to the attention of his companion.

""Ay,""  returned the composed scout, ""the Indians have hid the beasts with the judgment of natives! Water leaves no trail, and an owl's eyes would be blinded by the darkness of such a hole.""

The whole party was soon reunited, and another consultation was held between the scout and his new comrades, during which, they whose fates depended on the faith and ingenuity of these unknown foresters, had a little leisure to observe their situation more minutely.

The river was confined between high and cragged rocks, one of which impended above the spot where the canoe rested. As these, again, were surmounted by tall trees, which appeared to totter on the brows of the precipice, it gave the stream the appearance of running through a deep and narrow dell. All beneath the fantastic limbs and ragged tree-tops, which were, here and there, dimly painted against the starry zenith, lay alike in shadowed obscurity. Behind them, the curvature of the banks soon bounded the view, by the same dark and wooded outline; but in front, and apparently at no great distance, the water seemed piled against the heavens, whence it tumbled into caverns, out of which issued those sullen sounds that had loaded the evening atmosphere. It seemed, in truth, to be a spot devoted to seclusion, and the sisters imbibed a soothing impression of security, as they gazed upon its romantic, though not unappalling beauties. A general movement among their conductors, however, soon recalled them from a contemplation of the wild charms that night had assisted to lend the place, to a painful sense of their real peril.

The horses had been secured to some scattered shrubs that grew in the fissures of the rocks, where, standing in the water, they were left to pass the night. The scout directed Heyward and his disconsolate fellow-travellers to seat themselves in the forward end of the canoe, and took possession of the other himself, as erect and steady as if he floated in a vessel of much firmer materials. The Indians warily retraced their steps towards the place they had left, when the scout, placing his pole against a rock, by a powerful shove, sent his frail bark directly into the centre of the turbulent stream. For many minutes the struggle between the light bubble in which they floated, and the swift current, was severe and doubtful. Forbidden to stir even a hand, and almost afraid to breathe, lest they should expose the frail fabric to the fury of the stream, the passengers watched the glancing waters in feverish suspense. Twenty times they thought the whirling eddies were sweeping them to destruction, when the master-hand of their pilot would bring the bows of the canoe to stem the rapid. A long, a vigorous, and, as it appeared to the females, a desperate effort, closed the struggle. Just as Alice veiled her eyes in horror, under the impression that they were about to be swept within the vortex at the foot of the cataract, the canoe floated, stationary, at the side of a flat rock, that lay on a level with the water.

""Where are we? and what is next to be done?""  demanded Heyward, perceiving that the exertions of the scout had ceased.
""You are at the foot of Glenn's,""  returned the other, speaking aloud, without fear of consequences, within the roar of the cataract; ""and the next thing is to make a steady landing, lest the canoe upset, and you should go down again the hard road we have travelled, faster than you came up; 'tis a hard rift to stem, when the river is a little swelled; and five is an unnatural number to keep dry, in the hurry-skurry, with a little birchen bark and gum. There, go you all on the rock, and I will bring up the Mohicans with the venison. A man had better sleep without his scalp, than famish in the midst of plenty.""

His passengers gladly complied with these directions. As the last foot touched the rock, the canoe whirled from its station, when the tall form of the scout was seen, for an instant, gliding above the waters, before it disappeared in the impenetrable darkness that rested on the bed of the river. Left by their guide, the travellers remained a few minutes in helpless ignorance, afraid even to move along the broken rocks, lest a false step should precipitate them down some one of the many deep and roaring caverns, into which the water seemed to tumble, on every side of them. Their suspense, however, was soon relieved; for aided by the skill of the natives, the canoe shot back into the eddy, and floated again at the side of the low rock before they thought the scout had even time to rejoin his companions.

""We are now fortified, garrisoned, and provisioned,"" cried Heyward, cheerfully, ""and may set Montcalm and his allies at defiance. How, now, my vigilant sentinel, can you see anything of those you call the Iroquois, on the mainland?""

""I call them Iroquois, because to me every native, who speaks a foreign tongue, is accounted an enemy, though he may pretend to serve the king! If Webb wants faith and honesty in an Indian, let him bring out the tribes of the Delawares, and send these greedy and lying Mohawks and Oneidas, with their six nations of varlets, where in nature they belong, among the French!""

""We should then exchange a warlike for a useless friend! I have heard that the Delawares have laid aside the hatchet, and are content to be called women!""

""Ay, shame on the Hollanders[10] and Iroquois, who circumvented them by their deviltries, into such a treaty! But I have known them for twenty years, and I call him liar, that says cowardly blood runs in the veins of a Delaware. You have driven their tribes from the sea-shore, and would now believe what their enemies say, that you may sleep at night upon an easy pillow. No, no; to me, every Indian who speaks a foreign tongue is an Iroquois, whether the castle[11] of his tribe be in Canada, or be in New York.""

Heyward, perceiving that the stubborn adherence of the scout to the cause of his friends the Delawares or Mohicans, for they were branches of the same numerous people, was likely to prolong a useless discussion, changed the subject.

""Treaty or no treaty, I know full well, that your two companions are brave and cautious warriors! have they heard or seen anything of our enemies?""

""An Indian is a mortal to be felt afore he is seen,""  returned the scout, ascending the rock, and throwing the deer carelessly down.  ""I trust to other signs than such as come in at the eye, when I am outlying on the trail of the Mingos.""

""Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?""

""I should be sorry to think they had, though this is a spot that stout courage might hold for a smart skrimmage. I will not deny, however, but the horses cowered when I passed them, as though they scented the wolves; and a wolf is a beast that is apt to hover about an Indian ambushment, craving the offals of the deer the savages kill.""

""You forget the buck at your feet! or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt? Ha! what noise is that?""

""Poor Miriam!"" murmured the stranger; ""thy foal was foreordained to become a prey to ravenous beasts!"" Then, suddenly lifting up his voice, amid the eternal din of the waters, he sang aloud,—

          ""First born of Egypt, smite did He,
         Of mankind, and of beast also;
         O, Egypt! wonders sent 'midst thee,
         On Pharaoh and his servants too!""

""The death of the colt sits heavy on the heart of its owner,"" said the scout; ""but it's a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb friends. He has the religion of the matter, in believing what is to happen will happen; and with such a consolation, it won't be long afore he submits to the rationality of killing a four-footed beast, to save the lives of human men. It may be as you say, "" he continued, reverting to the purport of Heyward's last remark; ""and the greater the reason why we should cut our steaks, and let the carcase drive down the stream, or we shall have the pack howling along the cliffs, begrudging every mouthful we swallow. Besides, though the Delaware tongue is the same as a book to the Iroquois, the cunning varlets are quick enough at understanding the reason of a wolf's howl.""

The scout, whilst making his remarks, was busied in collecting certain necessary implements; as he concluded, he moved silently by the group of travellers, accompanied by the Mohicans, who seemed to comprehend his intentions with instinctive readiness, when the whole three disappeared in succession, seeming to vanish against the dark face of a perpendicular rock, that rose to the height of a few yards within as many feet of the water's edge.

Footnotes

[11] The principal villages of the Indians are still called ""castles"" by the whites of New York. ""Oneida castle"" is no more than a scattered hamlet; but the name is in general use.

[12] In vulgar parlance the condiments of a repast are called by the American ""a relish,"" substituting the thing for its effect. These provincial terms are frequently put in the mouths of the speakers, according to their several conditions in life. Most of them are of local use, and others quite peculiar to the particular class of men to which the character belongs. In the present instance, the scout uses the word with immediate reference to the salt, with which his own party was so fortunate as to be provided.",158295,en,en,en

Que va ensimismado
Y no se da cuenta
Que pisó el Edén
Hoy con muchos años
A cuestas lo veo:
Como la muchacha
Aquella de Bagé
Hoy con muchos años
Despierto y lo veo
Quien sueña con fuentes
Despierta con sed

A la misma muerte
No le temería
Como en el romance
Si buscándome
Los rasgos mostrara
Con el cuerpo limpio
De aquella morena

Vrondis Eyes,pop,Mercedes Lackey,1994,70,"{""Heather Alexander""}","[Verse 1]
A mage rode forth from Karse one day, a-fleeing for his life
He bore his staff beside his ancient sword and jeweled knife
He made a camp within a grove where much to his surprise
Adrift upon a sea of mist he saw a thousand eyes

[Chorus]
Eyes, wide unblinking eyes
As blue as the sky;
No mage can pass our borders
And escape the vrondi's eyes

[Verse 2]
A dark and wicked sorcerer who'd made a bloody pact
Came on a sleepy holding and the folk therein attacked
No sooner did he weave his spell and rouse their anguished cries
Then all at once he felt the glare of disembodied eyes

[Chorus]
Eyes, wide unblinking eyes
As blue as the sky;
No mage can pass our borders
And escape the vrondi's eyes
[Verse 3]
A witch of doubtful breeding and a crude, eclectic taste
Fled from the executioners across the tractless waste
But Valdemar was where that witch quite suddenly grew wise;
She cursed the day she ever felt those unrelenting eyes

[Chorus]
Eyes, wide unblinking eyes
As blue as the sky;
No mage can pass our borders
And escape the vrondi's eyes

[Verse 4]
So if you deal in magic better watch your step, my friend:
There's risk for you in Valdemar that you can't comprehend
The vrondi watch for magery; they are the Heralds' spies
And nothing can elude their vigilant, unresting eyes

[Chorus]
Eyes, wide unblinking eyes
As blue as the sky;
No mage can pass our borders
And escape the vrondi's eyes

[Chorus]
Eyes, wide unblinking eyes
As blue as the sky;
No mage can pass our borders
And escape the vrondi's eyes",5805924,en,en,en

[Intro]
Hey!
Nunca dejes que nadie te diga que no puedes hacer algo
Ni si quiera yo..¿vale? Vale
Si tienes un sueño tienes que protegerlo
Las personas que no son capaces de hacer algo
Te dirán que tú tampoco puedes
Si quieres algo ve por ello y punto

[Coro]
Mira al cielo y no mires atrás
Es momento de vivir soñando
Y mira al cielo y no lo pienses más
Es momento de vivir luchando

Mira al cielo y no mires atrás
Es momento de vivir soñando
Y mira al cielo y no lo pienses más
Es momento de vivir luchando
[Verso 1]
Lloraré cuando me vea muerto
Vea mi cuerpo y piense en que he hecho
Nada me puede cambiar ni mejorar
Que te jodan.vivo mi historia
Sin mal ni obra de cambio.estoy acabado
Cuentan que Ambkor es tan cerrado que nunca hablaría
Si no es por salir de su vida durante su album
Durante unos años andé dando cozes
Hoy lanzo golpes a hombres sin fe ni palabra
Conozco las farsas del panorama como mi palma
Van a caer por su propio peso, van a caer por mis huevos
Vuelvo de nuevo, sé lo que esto, soy el progreso
Y sigue mi vida por eso
Esto es Rap 24/7 mi voz es la voz de los tipos corrientes
Que siguen luchando por ser lo que sienten
Que viven y mueren por ser diferentes
Sienten y ven en la piel del oyente
Soñé que cantaba y cambié de repente
Y hoy soy más fuerte ¿lo ves?
Hoy puedo ver de otra forma las cosas de ayer
Déjame ser, volaré aunque no sepa
No hay quien me pare, hay quien lo intenta
Resucité entre una lluvia de mierda
Que vive y recibe encerrada en mi celda
Dónde una voz me dice:
Ambkor sueña que no estás triste
Ambkor resiste, te fuiste por ser
Y volviste más fuerte que ayer
Y con más cicatrices""

She Is...,rap,MC Rimmer,2012,36,{},"The sun shimmers bright lights, to brighten the soil of lover’s love
Before her, elegance was undreamed of
My joy runs through the veins of my body, and the amp the pump my heart
Strong enough to limit the end, loud enough to begin the start
Am I a fool for longing the beauty of passion, the essence of soul?
May the love be preserved in rubies, the affection lay, resting in gold
Of every night, the glimmering stars shine their fire
She’ll be there, nonchalantly present of her mental attire
For her heart is illuminating, like the moon’s reflection
The rhythm of a song, the vivid poetry of introspection
Her voice plays a long, mellow stream of melody
She’s as if she were sent from the clouds from above, her allure heavenly
A harp plays whenever her eyes bloom
She dashes across my mind like a sprying fume
She enchants the needs of my yearning heart
She is discerning, her words speak art
Of every ream I write, my love only grows
She is my love; she is the meadow of our plateau",67141,en,en,en

Объясни мне, что значит вчерашний сон
Но не надо врать, что он наполнен пустотой
Если нечего сказать, не говори мне ничего
Ну почему мне кажется, что всё наоборот:
Я во сне, где мне кажется, что я помню всё
Если я очнусь, проснётся кто-то другой
Чёртов парадокс, всё, что здесь имеет смысл превратится в ноль
Тогда в чём резон? Океан засохнув, превращается в каньон
Истина далеко, она за пределами нашего ""ничего""
И если это сон, тогда может быть меня разбудит гроб?

Hello? Who's there? My Name is Peter
You want me and Richard to come up and eat her?
Yo dude theres a girl with nice hips and she's lookin for some dicks to hop on
And our skills are spot on
Like picasso's shit in a gallery
But we dont do this shit for salary
Bitches, we destroy you chimps
We're pimps
Two honkeys destroyin punks
You monkeys we're gorillas
Ain't no pussy gonna thrill us
Our music makes the bitches fill their fuckin cups
Ansey and Frinessse, baby
You wanna dance lady?
Lyrics put you in a trance, maybe hop in my benz
That I dont have 'cause I'm broke
But I got enough for a blunt and some coke
And a condom ain't no problem
We ain't thugs,but still dont fear a man
Couple slugs and you will understand
We are like lamas with punchlines
It hurts when we spit
Muhfuckas we're the shit
[Verse 2: Ansey & Frinessse]
Aye yo, this is Ansey, chillin in your house
Man if you'd know, Outcast got endless hoes
One, two,.. 68, man, that's fine
Wait what comes after 68? (69)
57, 21 - that means Doggystyle
So fill up your Gin and Juice, and let's get drunk tonight
We those motherfuckers that steal your wives
Screm 'em right in front of you, and you'd still be cool with us - you a low life
-Alright, now listen up, check it out
We never started this to mess it up, or end up cowed
We here to chew y'all bakas, then spit y'all out
Fuck, Frinessse, how?, these fuckers are indebted (shit)
Bitches are happy now, cuz we made them wet (bitch)
""I'mma shoot 'em like 'pow', til they dead (hit)
I'mma walk up, ""huh"" now ya necks' red

Ill tase you phoney bitches,break yo shank
Fill yo ass with electricity like a Power bank

It's looks like it must have doubled
In sin and size since I been gone
Papers all full of killing
Half a million people willing
To die for something they have never known
City streets of trash and junk and stone

Grandfather's watch he gave me
Is just another memory
I have kept the way it always was
And ever since he died, it will not run
I always knew I was his favorite one

But he’s gone like the life of a child
When he turns hiss back on your mind
Tomorrow has no home sweet homes
Look what they've done to mine
Well it's just faded into time

And that old house we lived in
The roof is caving in
Like every other one along the block
Took 20 years to pay and 10 to rot
Now dad just stays that’s better off forgot
Says it’s gone like the life of a child...

But the green hills south of Nashville
Will rock the Harpeth Valley back to sleep
The river takes her winding time
She’s shallow but her thoughts are running deep
And abandoned old DeSoto
Found himself a perfect to sleep
Where all things dwell
And no tongue can tell
The secrets that the Harpeth Valley keep

Yeah the Civil War hit Franklin
Harder than the rest of Tennessee
But a 100 years ain’t nothing
The south will rise again and set them free
Well the winds of old blow lightly
Over the valley where the neverending dream
While the rusty tinroof barnyards
Crumble at the old grey farmers feet

But it’s gone like the life of a child...

Somehow I get to feeling
The cards that life is dealing
Don’t fit my hand quite like the lady’s does
Hers is a touch that I might trust
She ain’t nothing short of diamonds in the rough

Yaşıyoruz yaşanacak ne varsa
Taşıyor kalbimiz güneşin dağlardan taşırdığı bir sabahla
Sabır yok ve elbette aşk da
Bitmeyen -ah- aile kavgaları, kitap ve günahlardan hangine sövsek
Bize nasıl bir havayı soluduğumuzu
Ve özgür olmadığımızı kakışlamakta

Yaşıyoruz bilmem niye
Biri anlatsın bana yaşayacak ne varsa
Çevirip sorsun niye yaşadığını bilmeksizin yaşayan bir yaşayana
Yoksa karışmam barışamaz
Yaşamakla yeşeren ağaçlar gökle
Ânı yaşa diyeceksen sus
Anılarla yaşayanların saatleri dönmez

Böyleyim ne diyim
Çünkü çok uzaktan bile gelse silah sesleri
Belirir bütün kabzalarda bilirim şu garip parmaklarımın izleri
Bir çocuk ağlıyor dünyanın bilmediğim bir yerinde suç benim
Suç benim çünkü suçluyum
Birazdan öleceğim derdim de
Allahtan kurumayı bekler iki gömlek ve bir pantolonum
Allahtan sabaha da az kaldı ve ben yorulduğunu bilen bir yorgunum
Yoksa yok tavandan sarkmaktan çekincesi bu çamaşır ipinin
Sizi gidi yaşayanlar ne de çok seversiniz intiharlı cümlelerin hepini

Bir parça ekmek için dil döker
Attığın tekme için kin gütmez
Kaldığı yerden yine yaşar gider

Uçabiliyor özgürce ne güzel değil mi?
(Niçin?) Kırıntı bulmak ve sevişmek için bir başka güvercinle sürekli tabii ki

""Pisliğe sonra da bize konuyorlar"" diye yakınıyor müdür
Ah bu sinekler""
""Hayvan aç, aç"" diyor işçi (hah) gülerekten
Bak yaşamakta hayvan çiftliğindeki domuzlar
Yaşamak buysa
Yaşıyor yaşaması emredilen, ölmesi emredilene dek en yeniden
Benimse bakmayın sakın ellerime, silâh, kaşık, kalem var el yerine
Karşımdaysa vurulmayı bekleyen bir kadın, gözlerini yumuyor giderek
Sonra yine orada çöpe gidecek bir yemek, sonra boş bir kâğıt, bir emek?
Bak yaşamakta bir beşer (bak, bak, bak, bak) kin güder eğer fazla bakarsan
Bakma
Bomboş kâğıtlar okuyor
Sonra ağzını yemeğine değil yemeğini ağzına götürüyor, amma yok annesinin tembihi aklında
Ağlıyor yemekler arkasından (cık cık cık)

Şimdi diyelim ki karaladım kâğıtları, yanıtladım soruları, misal bir şarkı yazdım
Hadi diyelim ki daldırdım kaşığı, yiyeceğim kadar yedim, kalanını da attım
Diyelim ki tetiğe de bastım, gözüm kapalı, kalbimde bir mühür, kararlı

Le temps des oeufs au plat,pop,Joe Dassin,2015,124,{},"Paroles de la chanson Le Temps Des Oeufs Au Plat :
Toi, tu portais la barbe et moi
J’avais des bottes qui prenaient l’eau
Ensemble on écorchait Brassens
A la guitare et au banjo
Par flemme de rentrer se coucher
On faisait semblant de draguer
Ou on perdait des nuits entières
A discuter dans les cafés

C’était le temps, le temps des œufs au plat-La la la
C’était le temps des chambres sous les toits
Quand on dormait en grelottant dans nos manteaux
Sauf quand une fille nous tenait chaud
C’était le bon vieux temps

On se doutait bien que le mariage
C’était le service militaire à vie
Mais nous voilà devenus sages
Moi le témoin, toi le mari
Bientôt on se donnera rendez-vous
En regardant nos agendas
Et à ta femme j’apporterai
Des petits fours, un hortensia
Ce sera le temps, le temps des dimanches au bois-Ah la la
Le temps des tables pliantes et des poulets froids
D’un air patient, ta femme t’écoutera
Quand tu parleras encore une fois
De notre bon vieux temps

Et puis un beau soir, mal à l’aise
J’arriverai accompagné
Et un regard nous suffira
Pour voir que je vais y passer
Nous attendrons l’heure de la vaisselle
Quand les femmes s’en vont de leur côté
Alors du fond de nos cognacs
Et de nos cafés décaféinés

On retrouvera le temps des œufs au plat-La la la
Le joli temps des chambres sous les toits
Quand on dormait en grelottant dans nos manteaux
Sauf quand une fille nous tenait chaud

How could you?
How could you do this to me without a warning?
I cared about you but you never cared for me
How could you do this to me, a stagnant memory?
Once I find my way to the top I'll be looking down on you
Just like you did me
Maybe one day you'll learn...
Won't let this guard down and get pushed away again
You've all solidified that love and friendship comes with its press and I'm paying for it now
So this is what it costs for comfort and safety?
I stand alone, left behind, unwanted by people i thought cared for me
I stand alone, taking steps to find the people that matter most in life
(those people worth breaking your back for)
Do you feel a cold breeze?
Do you see the leaves fall?
I feel another year end and i feel another friend gone
I feel a cold breeze
I see these leaves fall
I feel another year end and another friend gone
Just know...
Once I find my way to the top I'll be reaching for the stars and not for you
As human beings we need a constant to balance out the fade
Something more than just a face in the passing clouds
Maybe one day we'll both see the same way
Maybe one day we'll both see eye to eye",4480882,en,en,en

La hierba en las güevas y la coca en la maleta

Aprenden a las buenas o aprendio a las malas

Municiones o las armas, nadie sabe qué nació primero
Voy a decirlo sin rodeos para ser sincero
Ve y quédate con lo elegante y yo con lo casero
La ocasión hace al que sea en el ocaso, nadie es diferente
Medio vacío, medio lleno el vaso
Sin pensamiento individual, somos soldados rasos
Y si hay sentido común, ¿por qué es tan escaso?
Andando por las calles me desplazo
Siempre de afán porque salieron con retraso
Hubo justicia, pero este no es el caso
Solo es la eterna negación por el rechazo

MICHAEL: The Corleone Family is thinking of giving up all its interests in the olive oil business – settling out here. *after Johnny hmmms* Now Moe Greene will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel so it could be completely owned by the Family. *gesturing towards Tom* Tom.

FREDO: Hey, Mike, are you sure about that? Moe loves the business – he never said nothin' to me about selling...

MICHAEL: Yeah well I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. *after Tom hands Michael a set of contracts* See, Johnny...see we figure that entertainment will be a big factor in drawing gamblers to the casino. And, we hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year. *then* Perhaps uh...convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same. We're counting on you...

MICHAEL: You're unlucky

MOE *standing, angrily laughs*: You goddamn guineas really make me laugh. I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out!

MICHAEL: Wait a minute. You took Freddie in because the Corleone Family bankrolled your casino because the Molinari Family on the Coast guaranteed his safety. Now we're talking business. Let's talk business...

MOE: Yeah let's talk business, Mike. First of all, you're all done. The Corleone Family don't even have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather's sick, right? You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other Families. What do you think is going on here? You think you can come to my hotel and take over? I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with him, and still keep my hotel!

MICHAEL: Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?

FREDO: Aw now that...that was nothin', Mike. Now uh Moe didn't mean nothin' by that. Sure he flies off the handle once in a while, but Moe and me we're good friends, right Moe? Huh?

MOE: I gotta business to run. I gotta kick asses sometimes to make it run right. We had a little argument, Freddy and I, so I had to straighten him out...

MICHAEL: You straightened my brother out?

MOE: He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time! Players couldn't get a drink at the table! What's wrong with you?

MICHAEL *collecting his things from the table before he stands*: I leave for New York tomorrow. Think about a price.

MOE *angry*: Son-of-a-bitch – Do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders!

FREDO: Wait a minute, Moe...Moe, I got an idea...*to Tom* Tom...Tom, you're the Consiglieri and you can talk to the Don – you can explain...

TOM: Just a minute now – the Don is semi-retired and Mike is in charge of the Family business now. If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.

FREDO *after Moe storms out*: Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

MICHAEL: Fredo – you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.

CUT TO: CORLEONE MALL

[Michael's limo drives through the gate with him, Kay, and Anthony. Anthony is sitting on Michael's lap.]

MICHAEL: I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me...

KAY: Oh, Michael...

MICHAEL: This weekend we'll go out. *after Kay hmmmms* We'll go to the city. We'll see a show and we'll have dinner. I promise.

KAY *after she and Michael kiss*: Okay...*then* Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants to ask you something...

MICHAEL: Well let her ask...

KAY: No she's afraid to. Connie and Carlo want you to be Godfather to their little boy.

MICHAEL: Oh, well we'll see...

KAY: Will you?

MICHAEL: Lemme think about it – we'll see. Come on.

[DISSOLVE TO: THE DON'S GARDEN]

[The Don, older looking now, sits with Michael.]

VITO CORLEONE: So Barzini will move against you first. He'll set up a meeting with someone that you absolutely trust...guaranteeing your safety. And at that meeting, you'll be assassinated. *as the Don drinks from a glass of wine as Michael watches him* I like to drink wine more than I used to anyway, I'm drinking more...

MICHAEL: It's good for you, Pop.

VITO CORLEONE *after a long pause*: I don't know your wife and children. Are you happy with them?

MICHAEL: Very happy...

VITO CORLEONE: That's good. *then* I hope you don't mind the way I...I keep going over this Barzini business...

MICHAEL: No, not at all...

VITO CORLEONE: It's an old habit. I spent my life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men. *then* How's your boy?

MICHAEL: He's good.

VITO CORLEONE: You know he looks more like you every day.

MICHAEL *smiling*: He's smarter than I am. Three years old, he can read the funny papers

VITO CORLEONE *laughs*: Read the funny papers. *then* Oh...well...eh, I want you to arrange to have a telephone man check all the calls that go in and out of here because...

MICHAEL: I did it already, Pop.

VITO CORLEONE: Ya know, cuz it could be anyone...

MICHAEL: Pop, I took care of that.

VITO CORLEONE: Oh, that's right. I forgot.

MICHAEL: *reaching over, touching his father*: What's the matter? What's bothering you? *after the Don doesn't answer* I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, I'll handle it.

VITO CORLEONE *as he stands*: I knew that Santino was going to have to go through all this. And Fredo...well...*after he sits besides
Michael* Fredo was...well. But I never...I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life, I don't apologize, to take care of my family. And I refused to be a fool dancing on the string, held by all those bigshots. I don't apologize that's my life but I thought that...that when it was your time that...that you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone, or something...

MICHAEL: Another pezzonovante...

VITO CORLEONE: Well this wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time...

MICHAEL: We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there...

VITO CORLEONE: Uh...*after kissing Michael on the cheek* Now listen. Whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting – he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

[DISSOLVE TO: THE DON'S TOMATO GARDEN – DAY]

[The Don is with Michael's son, Anthony.]

ANTHONY: Can I hold it, please? *taking the spray can from the Don* Yeah, I will take care...

VITO CORLEONE: Come're...come're...come're

[The Don shows Anthony how to use the spray can.]

ANTHONY: Can I water these?

VITO CORLEONE: Yeah over here...over here. Be careful, you're spilling it. You're spilling it... *after Anthony sprays a tomato plant* Anthony...com'ere...com'ere...com'ere... com'ere. There, that's right. We'll put it right there. Aie watch this. Come here.
I'll show you something, come here. Now you stand there...The Don cuts a piece of orange.

ANTHONY: Give me orange...The Don turns away and puts the piece of orange over his teeth. He turns toward Anthony, grunting and holding his arms up like a monster. Anthony is startled, and starts to cry. The Don rises, grabbing the boy.

VITO CORLEONE *laughing*: Oh no? *after picking up Anthony
then setting him down again* That's a new trick. *pointing to the tomato garden* You run in there...run in there... Anthony runs through the tomato garden, laughing, with the spray can. He and the Don are chasing each other.

ANTHONY *laughing*: See where are you? *then* Get down! The Don takes the orange peel out of his mouth, laughs, then coughs. He starts to fall, grabs for a plant, then falls to the ground. Anthony is still laughing and running around.

ANTHONY: I love you...*as he runs up to the Don with the spray can* Uh...uh...uh...uh...uh...uh...ouch! Anthony, seeing the Don's lifeless body, runs to the house.

[DISSOLVE TO: CEMETERY – DAY]

[We hear church bells as a procession of cars drives in. Chauffeurs
open car doors to let mourners out, including that old man who
sang Luna Mezz'o Mare at Connie's wedding reception. Michael, Tom, Mama, Connie and others are sitting in chairs in front of the
Don's flower-covered casket. They watch as mourners place single
red roses on top. We see Johnny, Clemenza, and his wife toss roses. Barzini tosses a rose, and glances at Michael and nods. We
see Tessio walking from Barzini, towards Michael.]

TESSIO *into Michael's ear*: Mike, could I have a minute? *after Michael and Tessio move away from the others* Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. He says we can straighten any of our problems out...

MICHAEL: You talked to him?

TESSIO: Yeah – I can arrange security. On my territory. Alright?

MICHAEL: Alright...

TESSIO: Alright.

TOM *after Michael sits besides him again*: Do you know how they're gonna come at'cha?

MICHAEL: They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground, where I'll be ""safe"".

TOM: I always thought it would've been Clemenza, not Tessio...

MICHAEL: It's a smart move – Tessio was always smarter. But I'm gonna wait – after the baptism. I've decided to be Godfather to Connie's baby. And then I'll meet with Don Barzini – and Tattaglia – all of the heads of the Five Families...

CUT TO: FULL SHOT OF THE INTERIOR OF A CHURCH

[Organ music is heard, and the baby is crying. Kay carries Carlo & Connie's baby toward the altar, followed my Michael.]

PRIEST *something in Latin; continues after breathing on baby three times; in Latin*: ""Let us pray..."" *after Michael and Kay untie
the baby's bonnet; something in Latin* While the priest continues off screen:

Wywiad z TrooMem - 11.04.2014,misc,GlamRap.pl,2014,318,{TrooM},"Wywiad przeprowadził portal GlamRap.pl

Podziemie ma się dobrze, a on jest tego najlepszym przykładem.

Młody, ambitny, zdolny, ale przede wszystkim wielki talent, który w wieku 17 lat wydaje swoją drugą solową płytę. Świeżo po premierze „Primus Luporum”. Album w całości wyprodukował toruński producent, ka-meal. Daniel zgodził się odpowiedzieć na parę moich pytań. Pogadaliśmy m.in. o jego najnowszej płycie, stronie RapGenius, a także o kondycji hip-hopu w Polsce. Zapraszam.

Na początku może wytłumacz, skąd wziął się tak abstrakcyjny pomysł na nazwę albumu. Jednego wilka na scenie już mamy.

TrooM: Czy taka abstrakcyjna? Nie wiem, stary. Mam wrażenie, że są bardziej przekminione opcje. Szukaliśmy z ka-mealem dobrej nazwy dla nowego albumu, który będzie przecierał zupełnie nieodkryty szlak. Może parę osób zajrzało w jego stronę, ale nikt inny się tam nie zapuścił. Ja zaś, miałem wielką chęć zrobienia akurat takiego konceptu na album. Padło na łacinę, bo wydawało mi się to zupełnie kozackie rekultywować w rapie wymarły język, ale jakoś w czasie produkcji posypał się ten pomysł i została jedynie sama nazwa. Tytuł - Primus Luporum (co oznacza mniej więcej ""pierwszy z watahy wilków""), wpadł nam do głowy za pierwszym razem gdy go tylko usłyszeliśmy. Cóż, lepiej oddaje cały zamysł płyty, niż nazwa samca alfa na przedzie stada? Uznaliśmy, że to jest najbardziej optymalny follow-up, który będzie do tego nawiązywał. Jeśli masz na myśli Bisza (którego serdecznie pozdrawiam!), to muszę odeprzeć zarzuty. Jest to wynik przypadku, a my kierowaliśmy się jedynie zamysłem.

Ile trwały prace nad albumem i jak rozpoczęła  się Twoja współpraca z ka-meal’em? To była Twoja propozycja, aby zrobić w całości album na jego bitach?

TrooM:  Po pierwsze: ten album pewnie by nie powstał gdyby nie invsbl, bo to właśnie nasza obecność w tym labelu, pozwoliła na wspólny kontakt. Dokładnie 30 marca 2013 roku, o godzinie 18:16, po tym jak wysłałem mu linka do kawałka Chcę więcej..."" ka-meal napisał: ""Czekam na TrooM x ka-meal"". Powiedziałem ""spoko""... i dotrzymałem słowa! Od tego czasu wszystko zaczynam liczyć. Następnie wysłał mi bity, które były zupełnie inne niż te, które kiedykolwiek słyszałem. Nie były mi bliski z niczym. Napisałem i nagrałem numer w szybkim tempie, ale wstrzymaliśmy się z wrzuceniem tego do internetu, ponieważ już brałem się za drugi. Wtedy pomyśleliśmy oboje, że może jednak fajnie by było zrobić coś więcej, niż tylko parę spontanicznych numerów. Jak zaczęliśmy robić to razem, to po co utrudniać sobie życie? Nasza praca była ekspresowa i przebiegła w kozackiej atmosferze. Raz śmialiśmy się z debilnych filmików na YouTubie, a innym razem jaraliśmy się wspólnymi rzeczami. Nie raz jednak wytykaliśmy sobie błędy dla dobra produkcji. Kończąc ten wątek, chcę tylko zaznaczyć, że żadna z obsuw, które miały miejsce nie była z naszej strony.

Czyli współpraca z jednym producentem lepiej wpływa na Ciebie, a także na rap, który tworzysz?

TrooM: Nie miałem nigdy okazji współpracować na dłuższą metę z innymi producentami. Dogadywaliśmy się z ka-mealem bez problemu, a to co bylo dziełem naszej współpracy było tylko następstwem idealnej kolaboracji. Nadawanie na tych samych falach, efekt taki jaki był zamierzony.

Nie masz pewnych obaw co do odbioru materiału?  Takiego albumu jeszcze nie było na polskim rynku. Popkiller w jednej ze swoich recenzji nazwał go nawet prekursorskim. Ludzie dopiero za parę lat mogą docenić ten krążek.

TrooM: Tworząc ten projekt zadawaliśmy sobie pytanie: - Czy nie jest na to za wcześnie? Szybko zmieniło się to w: - Jak nie my teraz, to kto? Na nasze szczęście i nieszczęście album wyszedł teraz.. Z żalem patrzyłem przez cały 2013 rok, jak czołowi artyści napierdalają moje patenty, które siedziały w szufladzie czekając na gotowy krążek. Mam czyste sumienie, bo to co zrobiłem jest inne i takie jak chciałem. Nie licze na to, że odbiór będzie na plus, bo sam uważałem, że na to jest za wcześnie. Myślałem nawet nad wyrzuceniem tego wszystkiego do kosza, albo puszczeniu za kilka lat przez niepowodzenia podczas produkcji i szukaniu tego odpowiedniego brzmienia. Pozytywne recenzje uskrzydlają, ale nie powiem, wolałbym konstruktywną krytykę. Fenomen Primus Luporum jest położony raczej w podejściu do jego produkcji. To nie miał być rap, to miała być muzyka. Oboje wytworzyliśmy styl, który możemy nazwać własnym. Próżno tu szukać kombinacji, bo albo dojdziemy do miejsca w którym powiemy ok, on jest kserem wszystkich, albo nie znam nikogo takiego, jak on. Zimne bity, które są idealnymi bangerami, tekst zawiły w różne środki stylistyczne, bez ""pleonazmów"". Jedyne co potrzeba to otworzyć głowę i słuchać. Krzysiek Nowak nawet nazwał to ""produktem skończonym"". Chciałbym go odpalić za kilka lat i się szczerze uśmiechnąć, mówiąc: zrobiłem to.
Po odsłuchu na pewno ma się odczucie, że goście na płycie nie zawiedli. Każdy nawinął dobrą zwrotkę. Trudno było zaprosić tak znanych raperów na swoją płytę? Bonson, Aleksander, Harry czy Enson to już dość uznane i wyrobione ksywki.

TrooM: Dokładna selekcja. Ograniczyliśmy liczbę wybranych osób o ponad 50%. Szczerze pierdolę wybijanie się na plecach innych, ale także takie samo nastawienie mam dla robienia rzeczy, w tzw. błędnym kole, zasięgu #kolesiostwo. Zarzuca się mi dwulicowość i szemrane interesy, podczas gdy jestem czysty, jak łza. Muzyka to muzyka. Moje ruchy, były moimi ruchami, przepraszam wszystkich, którzy poczuli się urażeni. Bonson sam do mnie napisał, z Harym zgadałem się jakoś przez internet. Olek napisał mi , że jeśli poczekam, bo nie ma możliwości na daną chwilę nagrać, to w to wejdzie bo jest mega zajarany, a Enson zgodził się bez problemu. Jeśli chodzi o Świnie, to znamy się już długo, a zwrotka na Młode Wilki tylko pokazała jego możliwości. Poza tym, jeśli tacy ludzie chcą uczestniczyć na twoim albumie, to o czymś świadczy. Nikt z nich nie zawiódł, dali z siebie 110%.

Ka- meal nie zasugerował Ci, aby kogoś zaprosić na płytę? Czy była to tylko i wyłącznie Twoja decyzja kto na płycie się znajdzie.

TrooM: Wspólna, przemyślana decyzja. Nie ma tu nikogo przypadkiem.

Ostatnio zapanowała moda na rapgeniusa. Sam masz tam zweryfikowane konto i czasem poprawiasz swoje teksty, ale jak jest z dosłownym tłumaczeniem linijek. Wolisz to zostawiać słuchaczom  do ich własnej analizy i interpretacji czy jednak wolisz dawać im pewne wskazówki?

TrooM: Tak, śledzę RapGeniusa już długo. Nie powiem, parę razy mogłem przez to inaczej zrozumieć teksty. Jeszcze ta opcja z poezją czy rockiem- genialna sprawa. Wyobraź sobie moją radość w momencie, gdy zostałem zweryfikowany, co ustawia mnie obok Kendricka, A$AP Rocky’ego, Maca Millera czy Nasa, bo baza jest ta sama dla wszystkich krajów. Rap ma to w sobie, że zmusza do samodzielnego myślenia. Jeśli sam tego nie zrobisz, nikt inny Ci nie pomoże. Nie zrozumiesz tego. Pomagam mojemu audytorium ze względu na to, że nie jestem rozpoznawalną osobą. Dosyć mało o mnie wiadomo, a wersy są z reguły bardzo osobiste. Pokierowałem ich na początku, a dalej już sami płyną!

3 klipy promujące album już są („Lotos”, „Myślokształt”, „Querela”). Pojawi się coś jeszcze?

TrooM: Tak, będzie klip do „Insomni” z Olkiem. Reszta pozostaje tajemnicą.

A kwestia koncertów? Pojawiają się już pierwsze propozycje zagrania z tym materiałem na żywo?

TrooM: Dogadujemy wszystko. Dla sprawdzenia, kilka razy zagrałem kawałki z płyty. Przed i teraz raz po premierze. Odbiór był co najmniej groteskowy, ale w pełni przeze mnie zrozumiały. Marzą mi się koncerty nie tylko w typowej rapowej (hip-hopowej) konwencji. Coś nawet bardziej z przemyślanym show, ale to swoją drogą.

A jak oceniasz sam poziom rapu w Polsce? Jest ktoś taki na naszej rodzimej scenie z kim marzy Ci się nagranie wspólnego numeru?

TrooM: Tendencja rosnąca. Zaczyna się dziać. Nie mi to oceniać, ja tylko tworzę muzykę. Jestem zwykłym, szarym człowiekiem, który chcę przeobrazić swoją wizję w czyny. Od statystyk są inni ludzie. Sentymentalnie na pewno Małpa. Kilka numerów o czymś znam na pamięć (klasyk w dniu premiery), z 2stym fajnie było by także coś skleić, Sitek także (ale z tym mocnym, który zostawia szmaty z niczym, bo to flow da radę wszędzie). Jest jeszcze garstka osób, ale nie chcę ich wymieniać, bo boje się, że kogoś pominę, albo się zamotam, jak przy jednym z wywiadów kiedy w ogóle nie wymieniłem Kanye'go Westa, który jest poniekąd moim autorytetem, co jest mega dziwne.

Co dalej? Kolejna płyta w drodze? Czy jednak chwila wytchnienia. I dopiero z czystym umysłem wracasz do studia nagrywać kolejne kawałki.
TrooM: Obawiam się, że nie będzie teraz czasu na chwilę wytchnienia. Masz tylko jedną szansę. Wykorzystaj więc ją mądrze. Nie chcę zapeszać, ale chcę podnieść poprzeczkę jeszcze wyżej. Brawura to podstawa. Jedyne co mogę powiedzieć, że na pewno będzie się działo.

Wielkie dzięki za poświęcony czas!

TrooM: Dziękuje również, bardzo miła konwersacja. Powodzenia na przyszłość. Korzystając z okazji , chciałbym pozdrowić moją dziewczynę, Sylwię. Gdyby nie ona, na pewno wszystko inaczej by wyglądało.",427686,pl,pl,pl

花田遇上了春暖
花瓣夏雨灑風中轉
百折千廻就放開 秋色染面
老情人 心照不宣
冬雪會倦情感會亂
睡醒已是明天
仍期待下一花季可再見
[主歌三]
情深不見底不必怕緣淺
會承受你的改變
我從未要你解釋 沒有名份的吻
無忘花枝不需折
Ha

花笑獨欠人不見
不記明日黃花昨日現
百折千廻 時日流轉不了斷
好情人 有聚有別
總可再遇抱擁每段
再想已是明天
長留在我心的你不會變

愛如願隨年轉厚
換你回贈一吻

Truth,rap,Atomic,2015,22,{},"Sitting here spend my days in real pain
So I’m using all the music to help keep me sane
I try not to complain but it’s every fucking day
And stupid motherfuckers think it’s all a game
Why
Would I spend this time
Why
Would I write these lines
If I wasn’t bringing movement
By opening up your eyes
AAAGGH
Damn I be doing it again
I’m off on a tangent and I feel my head spin
As I’m sitting writing
Don’t know where to begin
Feel like I’ve said it all and you want me to say it again
No fuck you all
I’m always fucking tired and I fight for my cause
You be able bodied and you always fucking lost
When I been showing you how to do it with every single toss
Not a single person wants to go and support
But every single person think they got a report
Why
Don’t you get the point before I kill a fucker let me light this joint
Please give me an answer cause I’m getting really confused
Do you lack in motivation or are you lacking in a muse
Your life fucking sucks well Mine does too
But while you looking lazy I’m making it better dude
I fight twelve times harder than these motherfuckers do
And you know if I spit it That your only getting truth
I’m always in the booth work around the clock
Music is my life I could never stop
You be sitting there like I had a bad day
And I don’t even know what the hell to say
Cause for me
No Pains not an option
But I still get up and every day I clock in
Yeah I see you talking but I never see you walking
What the fuck are you doing while I always keep it rocking
Nothing
As far as I can tell you be acting like your living in a hell
For six years doctors ruined my life
And I finally took the time to try and make it right
But I can’t cause the insurance fucked up
So unless I move ahead and get the money stacked up
I’m fucked out of luck they take the bucks that I got
But if I don’t do the shit I might fucking drop
So I never stop
I just keep on fighting
Hitting the game quick like a triple bolt of lightning
Frightening to some so they say
I’m like fuck em all trying to enjoy my day
I’m taking over the game
I said I didn’t come to play
And the more pain you bring the more my demons have to say
Tired of these people trying to get up in my biz
Everytime I see em its like I’m taking a fucking quiz
But you know that I’m a whiz and I never give the answers
Cause you pollute my energy it’s like you are a cancer
Bastards
Trying to ruin my fun you gossip about the One in front of the gun
Or the Rhythmic on a Gray day
If you fucking with my family you better step away
Go and listen to the music that we play
Sit and hear the message that we say
Cause we do it everyday dropping knowledge everyway
On the beat bring the heat while you looking so fake
Nobody ever wants to work for shit
All they want is what you get
Better put it to rest cause you know we the best
Get the fuck out my face go take your own test
I Truly know how a King feels
I keep showing y’all how to do it
And you keep doing it wrong",2321850,en,en,en
Seems Endless,rock,Mourning Sign,1994,25,{},"Take me by the hand my friend
I'll lead you through the night
Don't be afraid my friend
We've passed the hardest part - life

Don't look into the eyes of the unborn
They'll decieve you with their lies
Don't fall for the beauty of the devout shape
It'll keep your soul - forever

Listen - hear the lament of the gods
Searching for peace in a higher world
Touch - feel the anger within
This tower of griefs for the abandoned ones

Taste the sweet drops from the well of truth
It gives you all the answers

Endless seems the path we wander
The final phase begin to affect
See can you discern the dim light
Do the brightness blind your eyes
Don't seek knowledge about the question of life
It's too hard to solve for man

You must go alone my friend
Beyond this challenging stage
Take care now my friend
Make your faith fulfill

Few is chosen but everyone's invited",990089,en,en,en

You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah—open sesame, mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling—you can't match it
I rap-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty, come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so, baby, pour me some Jack Daniel's

No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package, and I'm cool—I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's—I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days—they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free—hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus, it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly, on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now, he's doubling backwards, and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now, he's up in the bathroom, like he's busting a nat
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back!
[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink

Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

I’m lifted, I bagged your dopest shit and sniffed it
I said, “Give me it,” and you did, kid—you a idiot
You moronic, gnawed on this apparatus, ignoramus
Slipping on banana clips.  Shooting stars make planets shift
[Mr. Metaphor]
Trooping, stomping through your borough like I’m stupid
With a 30 IQ, smacking stickers on your corner
I’m out there—(Where at?)—I’m right about where you standing
From Brooklyn (Brooklyn!) to DuMont like Ralph Kramden
[Block McCloud]
I’m not [slammed and?] space-coasting with no suit
Got stranded with no loot, face frozen, snot’s hanging
I’m dumb, retarded, come and start a fight like undercard kids
Cause a stink like underarmpit—yo, someone farted

I’m stupid from taking trips and popping shrooms
Seemed like the opportune time for where to drop a tune
Give Block some room to operate, come clean like mopping room
And hit the spot for boom, (transform to Dr. Doom)
I stock the vocal room with trucks of beer while I’m stuck in here
Keep you at Bay like a Buccaneer, spit in your fucking ear
I’m talking here.  Don’t interfere—I’ll singe your hair
Stuff you with shells like San Gennaro’s Fair—I took it there.  The Brooklyn look, it’s
(Metaphor) headed for the corner store
Where we gonna battle four more cats up in the corridor
We had a poor rapport—we couldn’t get along, but Met was wrong
He said...
[Mr. Metaphor]
I said, “Your moms smell like soldiers out in Lebanon”
At the concert, my palms hurt
Holding the mic, controlling it right, put y’all in the sights
I’m rolling it tight.  All my soldiers glow in the night
I’m throwing the mic.  Be froze in my sight—I’m clothed in ice
I’m older than Christ and bigger than life
I’ve been in your wife—I’m sinning tonight
I’m quicker than light, I’m sicker than Mike
Son, you must be hitting the pipe and sniffing the white
Word ‘A Mouth living the life like...

Only makes me as prolific as the first time you heard Nas

But now you see me glide above the heavens in the sky
So high just so I can see the eyes of God

With just a few asking questions
Like what do their leaders say
In sessions behind closed doors
And if this is the perfect way
Why do we need these goddamn lies?
This doesn't go down too well
""We give you everything and you throw it back
Don't like it here you can go to hell
You're either with or against us...""

It's got the biggest of everything
Try to attack it and you can't hide
Don't say that you haven't been warned
You can't hide in a gunman's mask
Or kill innocent folks and run
But if you're good at it they might ask—
Come on over to the other side
There's a country that's tired of war
There's a country that's scared inside
But the bank is open and you can draw
For guns to fight in their backyard

You can't fight them with songs

The light of the ancient world shines bright
Blessing the dark children of the valley
By this gold brilliance they are cleansed
The dog and the wolf howl as one

The twisted village cries out
With one voice
They scream at the heavens
With disdain and wonder
As the beasts rise
From beneath the waves

They come to tear flesh from bone
Love and sadness
Manifest both celebration and funeral

The moon rests within the river
Here in the valley of dust
Pale faces offer their invitations
And the shadow beings answer
Within the sixteenth encampment
Desolation and ecstasy reigns
Under a blood red moon
They mourn those taken away
In the cold grass they lay
Under a blood red moon they weep

The beasts will rise up
From the deep
And look you all in the eye

Yeah, I know we kicked it way before the days of Myspace
But once I hit it I won't drop you off at my place
And your girlies like to claim I'm ungrateful
You know that's not the case because I'm just unfaithful
God, you talking bout how you should be with all these better men
How you a dime cause they shoutin' ""shawty you a ten!""
How I'm Kevin Durant, you just want a veteran
I don't think I'm staying that long I got some other plans
So give me one reason like you was Tracy Chapman
Otherwise we can't really make it happen
Moving smooth like satin
Every Saturday night, on the phone, tellin me
How I'm just a player, learn the trait from Mr. Bellamy
It's not a felony, though you like to yell at me
I know we used to be so close like Kenan and Kel would be
That's hard to swallow when I spit it, embellishing in
And why we on the subject of life, can I get the rent?
And on the subject of strife, can you let me vent?
Oh fuck it Obey, hit them with the chorus man

Joseph Andrews Chap. 3.9,misc,Henry Fielding,1742,7,{},"        Containing as surprizing and bloody adventures as can be found in this or perhaps any other authentic history.

        It was almost morning when Joseph Andrews, whose eyes the thoughts of his dear Fanny had opened, as he lay fondly meditating on that lovely creature, heard a violent knocking at the door over which he lay. He presently jumped out of bed, and, opening the window, was asked if there were no travellers in the house? and presently, by another voice, if two men and a woman had not taken up there their lodging that night? Though he knew not the voices, he began to entertain a suspicion of the truth—for indeed he had received some information from one of the servants of the squire's house of his design—and answered in the negative. One of the servants, who knew the host well, called out to him by his name just as he had opened another window, and asked him the same question; to which he answered in the affirmative. O ho! said another, have we found you? and ordered the host to come down and open his door. Fanny, who was as wakeful as Joseph, no sooner heard all this than she leaped from her bed, and, hastily putting on her gown and petticoats, ran as fast as possible to Joseph's room, who then was almost drest. He immediately let her in, and, embracing her with the most passionate tenderness, bid her fear nothing, for he would die in her defence. ""Is that a reason why I should not fear,"" says she, ""when I should lose what is dearer to me than the whole world?"" Joseph, then kissing her hand, said, ""He could almost thank the occasion which had extorted from her a tenderness she would never indulge him with before."" He then ran and waked his bedfellow Adams, who was yet fast asleep, notwithstanding many calls from Joseph; but was no sooner made sensible of their danger than he leaped from his bed, without considering the presence of Fanny, who hastily turned her face from him, and enjoyed a double benefit from the dark, which, as it would have prevented any offence, to an innocence less pure, or a modesty less delicate, so it concealed even those blushes which were raised in her.

        Adams had soon put on all his clothes but his breeches, which, in the hurry, he forgot; however, they were pretty well supplied by the length of his other garments; and now, the house-door being opened, the captain, the poet, the player, and three servants came in. The captain told the host that two fellows, who were in his house, had run away with a young woman, and desired to know in which room she lay. The host, who presently believed the story, directed them, and instantly the captain and poet, justling one another, ran up. The poet, who was the nimblest, entering the chamber first, searched the bed, and every other part, but to no purpose; the bird was flown, as the impatient reader, who might otherwise have been in pain for her, was before advertised. They then enquired where the men lay, and were approaching the chamber, when Joseph roared out, in a loud voice, that he would shoot the first man who offered to attack the door. The captain enquired what fire-arms they had; to which the host answered, he believed they had none; nay, he was almost convinced of it, for he had heard one ask the other in the evening what they should have done if they had been overtaken, when they had no arms; to which the other answered, they would have defended themselves with their sticks as long as they were able, and God would assist a just cause. This satisfied the captain, but not the poet, who prudently retreated downstairs, saying, it was his business to record great actions, and not to do them. The captain was no sooner well satisfied that there were no fire-arms than, bidding defiance to gunpowder, and swearing he loved the smell of it, he ordered the servants to follow him, and, marching boldly up, immediately attempted to force the door, which the servants soon helped him to accomplish. When it was opened, they discovered the enemy drawn up three deep; Adams in the front, and Fanny in the rear. The captain told Adams that if they would go all back to the house again they should be civilly treated; but unless they consented he had orders to carry the young lady with him, whom there was great reason to believe they had stolen from her parents; for, notwithstanding her disguise, her air, which she could not conceal, sufficiently discovered her birth to be infinitely superior to theirs. Fanny, bursting into tears, solemnly assured him he was mistaken; that she was a poor helpless foundling, and had no relation in the world which she knew of; and, throwing herself on her knees, begged that he would not attempt to take her from her friends, who, she was convinced, would die before they would lose her; which Adams confirmed with words not far from amounting to an oath. The captain swore he had no leisure to talk, and, bidding them thank themselves for what happened, he ordered the servants to fall on, at the same time endeavouring to pass by Adams, in order to lay hold on Fanny; but the parson, interrupting him, received a blow from one of them, which, without considering whence it came, he returned to the captain, and gave him so dexterous a knock in that part of the stomach which is vulgarly called the pit, that he staggered some paces backwards. The captain, who was not accustomed to this kind of play, and who wisely apprehended the consequence of such another blow, two of them seeming to him equal to a thrust through the body, drew forth his hanger, as Adams approached him, and was levelling a blow at his head, which would probably have silenced the preacher for ever, had not Joseph in that instant lifted up a certain huge stone pot of the chamber with one hand, which six beaus could not have lifted with both, and discharged it, together with the contents, full in the captain's face. The uplifted hanger dropped from his hand, and he fell prostrated on the floor with a lumpish noise, and his halfpence rattled in his pocket; the red liquor which his veins contained, and the white liquor which the pot contained, ran in one stream down his face and his clothes. Nor had Adams quite escaped, some of the water having in its passage shed its honours on his head, and began to trickle down the wrinkles or rather furrows of his cheeks, when one of the servants, snatching a mop out of a pail of water, which had already done its duty in washing the house, pushed it in the parson's face; yet could not he bear him down, for the parson, wresting the mop from the fellow with one hand, with the other brought his enemy as low as the earth, having given him a stroke over that part of the face where, in some men of pleasure, the natural and artificial noses are conjoined.

        Hitherto, Fortune seemed to incline the victory on the travellers' side, when, according to her custom, she began to show the fickleness of her disposition; for now the host, entering the field, or rather chamber of battle, flew directly at Joseph, and, darting his head into his stomach (for he was a stout fellow and an expert boxer), almost staggered him: but Joseph, stepping one leg back, did with his left hand so chuck him under the chin that he reeled. The youth was pursuing his blow with his right hand when he received from one of the servants such a stroke with a cudgel on his temples, that it instantly deprived him of sense, and he measured his length on the ground.

        Fanny rent the air with her cries, and Adams was coming to the assistance of Joseph; but the two serving-men and the host now fell on him, and soon subdued him, though he fought like a madman, and looked so black with the impressions he had received from the mop, that Don Quixote would certainly have taken him for an inchanted Moor. But now follows the most tragical part; for the captain was risen again, and, seeing Joseph on the floor, and Adams secured, he instantly laid hold on Fanny, and, with the assistance of the poet and player, who, hearing the battle was over, were now come up, dragged her, crying and tearing her hair, from the sight of her Joseph, and, with a perfect deafness to all her entreaties, carried her downstairs by violence, and fastened her on the player's horse; and the captain, mounting his own, and leading that on which this poor miserable wretch was, departed, without any more consideration of her cries than a butcher hath of those of a lamb; for indeed his thoughts were entertained only with the degree of favour which he promised himself from the squire on the success of this adventure.

        The servants, who were ordered to secure Adams and Joseph as safe as possible, that the squire might receive no interruption to his design on poor Fanny, immediately, by the poet's advice, tied Adams to one of the bed-posts, as they did Joseph on the other side, as soon as they could bring him to himself; and then, leaving them together, back to back, and desiring the host not to set them at liberty, nor to go near them, till he had further orders, they departed towards their master; but happened to take a different road from that which the captain had fallen into.",137544,en,en,en

But we would let time slip away right under that summer sun
And we'd go full speed careless as a child
Lost at the sight our own imaginations for a while

Is that a triple, up the middle
Better know when you round first
Stretch for that first down even if it hurts
Inside those walls felt like the safest place on earth

Hell I’m not scared to leave 'em but I just wanna say
Thank the Lord in heaven for such a place to play
Talk quickly turns to memories I’ll thank them all away
Won’t let myself give in when this begins to fade

With the rock in my hand I’m the rocket man
Superstar with a cosmic plan, tell the fans just watch me man, huh

Surveyin' the field, I got the quarterback vision
Somebody pass me the ball and I can show them my mission
Cross ‘em over until I can cross over another dimension

A place to lose, a place to bruise
A place to rule, a place to screw
A place too cool
A place to dance and take a chance
On romance and make some so called advancements
A place for lives to be spendin'
When lies for listening to hide the wisdom
Mind over matter but it seems the twist this
Without the matter the mind could have never existed

Yeah, popping off like a Mentos to a soda
You just grind out super nova
Underground like Cloverfield Lane
But I’m movin' closer to the surface
I move it over, by the crack of the bat

The only walls that can contain it are this place that we’re at
And that’s the only walls that matter as a matter of fact
I guess it’s all fun and games until the day they collapse

Veo tus manos aún fuertes

Cry No More,rap,Phonte,2018,9657,{},"[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers can't cry no more, when you die no more
It's a crying shame, you don't even try no more
Black suits, black ties and obituaries handed out
Ashes to ashes after living life, hand to mouth
A deathwish is cool till its time to blow the candles out
I need some answers now, leaving your sons is tantamount
To throwing 'em straight to the wolves
And everybody saying they'd be different if they had a man around
He loved his work and his women built like a Clydesdale
Went to the city in search of supreme clientele
And back to the country, frontin' like he Mr. Drysdale
Just an illusion, a ruse, an ol' wives tale
While I was in the 'Boro where the dope and the gun work
Had the whole 'hood soundin' like Dunkirk
Starin' at my celing fan, tryin' to be a man
Wishin' I had a chance to be his son first

[Interlude]
""You know, it's crazy 'cause like when I was a kid. My dad used to pick me up from school. He was an executive chef and he would bring me to the kitchen. I would be so excited to cook
And you know he'd be like, ""Nah, you need to, you need to prep. You need to do preparation."" And I didn't understand it at the time but he was teaching me about life
[Verse 2]
They ask me where I been, dog I been rebuilding
With my wiz and children, put my pops in the ground
Then hit the repast and ate the same shit that killed him
Your habits didn't deviate, just thought you would appreciate
My moms used to say I was a whore just like you
So Ma, I ran through even more just to spite you
And Pops, my health is doin' pretty good despite you
I try so I don't die at 54 just like you, cold
I'm one snowflake away from an avalanche
My first teachers were masters of self-sabotage
My momma walking slower these days, she got a stent
Still on them Newports, where's your fuckin' common sense?
Pardon my French, I'm just still unconvinced
That as young as you are, soon I'll be takin' care of you
I get it you're the one who did the raising, I'm the son
But I'm not ready to cry at your Lorraine Hansberry-al
You can't undo it you either succumb to it
Make the adjustment or just become numb to it
Looking over your life like ""what have I done"" to it
Knowing your bloodline is the river that runs through it
My sons look at me these days and think I'm certified
Preparing them for a world they'll be deserted by, internalize
Black Man if you get a teaspoon of compassion, that's more than double the serving size
I get impatient, shit is taking too long
They don't get it, I really lived it, you can say what you want
'Cause by the time you realize that your father was right
You'll probably have your own son telling you that you wrong
But be his ride or die, even if you two ain't seein' eye to eye
Teach him how to throw a punch, ride a bike, tie a tie
Hold on to 'em while you can, this is just what I advise

Zostawią ślad na wieki nim powieki dzieci zamkną nam
Z ostatnią szklanką czas - wypije do dna
Za spraw bagaż w tonach, które kiedyś wessą do dna nas
Przez brudne okna będę spoglądał na świat
Który zapomniał jak ma zachować dobrą twarz
Dziś nie leje łez na chodnik za tych którzy sto lat stąd są
Niech leje wciąż samotny z nadzieją, że wrócić zdążą tu
Że może tak chciał Bóg, taki miał plan na stu
Za wszystkie grzechy które sumą są nas dwóch, lub
Wrogów ucieszy fakt, że taki stan znów mam
Że wątpię w rzeczy których pewien byłem cały czas
Historia lubi zawracać - to pewne jak to, że
Dobro skraca drogę, którą budujesz lata
I co? Gwiazdy gasną przecież
Chociaż ich światło wędruje lata świetlne przez bezkres

Chuj że boli, na przekór światu zaprzecz

One of the joys of being a travelling musician is the people we meet and the places we visit

As the evening settles slowly over fields of emerald green
I wander through my memories to places that I’ve seen
To the friends we’ve met along the way, the towns we’ve driven through
And I think of all the riches that I’ve known because of you

Hеre we are togеther let our voices ring
Here we are this evening, let us sing

Let’s forget the world for just a while
And toast the friends we’ve made
Let’s sing a chorus, raise a glass
Until we meet again

With boats and planes, through snow and rain, we’ve travelled many miles
Seen wondrous places big and small and sampled their delights
Heard many different languages, sang songs of love and war
And when we head for home again your voices take us far
Here we are together let our voices ring
Here we are this evening, let us sing

Let’s forget the world for just a while
And toast the friends we’ve made
Let’s sing a chorus, raise a glass

In the morning as we’re moving on, you’ll travel in our hearts
Each journey brings us many things to cherish as we part
The car piled high with souvenirs we’ll hit the road once more
And your voices in our memory will always feel like home

Бьёт людей большая рама
Он с улыбкой, кожа в шрамах
Но а ему бит говорит
Бит говорит: пиздец ты, тип
Тяжёлая штанга, тяжёлые ботинки
Если ты ссыкло, тебе не хуй делать в ринге
(Куплет 1)
Да, тебе нехуй делать в ринге
Мы бравые парни в серых кварталах
Это наш андер из тёмных подвалов
Здесь трудно судить об идеалах
Так что нас всех называют вандалами

Да, кому доверишь свою жизнь, кому правду
На заднем два брата
Да и не вылезая из залов
Мы мутим движение
Это минский наш андер
(Куплет 3)
Убережён тот, кто с ножом
Опережён тем, кто со стволом
Штанга драться не научит, но научит сильно бить
Нас всё больше, мы всё злее
Это всё, что мы умеем
Я бы стал качаться с детства, если был бы поумнее
Головы под ноль дружно все побреем
(Куплет 4)
Своих мнений не привыкли менять здесь
Здесь не похуй, что у тебя там по понятиям
Как учил меня батя
Достойно прожить свою жизнь — это цель
Прямо идти и не набивать цен
Быть воином среди всех тающих тел
Двигаться трезво — вот наш удел
(Куплет 5)
Храни в себе, мой андеграунд
Свободу, жизнь и спорт цени
Таскай с собой кастет и нож
Тату на тело наноси
Добро должно быть с кулаками
Кулак с добром не должен быть
Прославиться нельзя хорошими делами
За плохие нужно будет заплатить

Don't know what I’m doing

Life has got me going in

Different directions

Making connections

I'm at a crossroad

It's a Busy intersection

So many decisions

So many visions

Imma plan it with precision
I believe in my self

Don’t wanna go to college

But I gotta get the knowledge

So y'all can acknowledge my flow

Pay homage to my bros

My boi Ross the mans

I'm not holding out my hands

I'm Playing with the band

I don't beg but I do this on the reg ular

Don't call my cell ular device

Unless you talking bout a price

I'm not worried about getting ice

Going for my dreams, roll the dice
I just wanna pay my rent

Tell these haters to get bent

I don't fuck with the fent ynal

But all in all ready to ball

I be on the airwaves like a aerosol

Almost lost my life, close call

This verse so crazy it’s awol

Imma just Let the beat fall



Life beats you down and you gotta crawl

But you still moving, we still grooving

My flow stays improving

The vibe is very soothing
Got a 5 years plan brewing

My music is just blooming

So me and my team cruising



Homie drank to much he puking

I’m smoking the night away

Coming up with shit to say

Love yourself in every way

I'm on a mission

To get some commission

So Shut the fuck up and listen



Love yourself In sickness

And in health

Don’t follow life

For wealth

Do what you love

We all end up up above

Sometimes an angry person needs a hug

They might look at you with a shrug

With a frowny mug

Good atmosphere around me

Call me slug

Murder the lyrics

Roll em in a rug

Caretaker of the beat

You can call me bug

My circle sealed

My hearts healed

Me and my dawgs

Do this for real

I'm in the booth on this song

Punchlines  like a gong

I go splash in beer pong

Splash in that pussy

All night long

They want me to fall

I'm just waiting on my call

Till The day I fly away

To LA and make it to the top

Skinny boi won't ever stop

Not a felon but fuck a op

My gun don’t pop

But I'm on the clock

Working all night

Ya boi won't fight

He'll just ask for the light

This song will get the hype

Just lay back smoke your pipe

It's gunna be alright

Sauce Island,rap,RREVAN,2018,272,"{""Mars Playground""}","[Verse 1: rrevan]
We livin', vibin' in Miami with the heat
Party every night, nah we never sleep
Rari out back, ain't got no keys
Push start, doing donuts, ain't no Krispy Kreme
Heard that you in town
Got your mans missin'
Hop in the whip, automatic transmission
Like I got a genie, how ya'll stay wishin
All these diamonds iced up, make my hands glisten
My diamonds dance, I just saw 'em hit the folks
Rrevan got em mad, wrist all froze (ay)
Just checked a bag, spent three hunnid on the clothes
Wavy beat, wavy bars, wavy flow, ayy
Fur came off a bear, fur came off a lion
Runnin' circles round you, I ain't even tryin'
Sun goes down but the vibe don't stop
Pulled up, new whip, but the roof stay dropped

[Chrous: Mars Playground]
My shorty know how to party
But she don't know how to say sorry
Come closer now, keep dancin' till it's over now

[Verse 2: rrevan]
Balmain jeans, they don't sag, I wear Gucci belts
Lil rrevan comin' up, we winnin', all ya'll losin' out
This 'rari ain't on lease
Push start, ain't no keys
Gucci on me, yellow jacket like the bees
Gold rims, we go in
It's so sin, what the flow brings
Gucci clothes got no lint
Melodic flow, you already know
Hop up on the track with all my diamonds, I turn it cold
Authentic gold, that's what my wrist be
Cost about $60, you know it ain't misty
Foreign cars, no roof, you can see the stars
Yeah the knows us in New York, yeah we milly rock
I don't drive no whip, I copped me a starship
Millennium falcon, I got me a Hoth wrist
I keep my money high and I keep the rari low
I keep the bars hot but I keep the wrist froze

[Chrous: Mars Playground]
My shorty know how to party
But she don't know how to say sorry
Come closer now, keep dancin' till it's over now
X2
[Bridge: Mars Playground]
Feelin' good all the time
Tropical island vibes
Never felt so alive
Feel your heart, feel your soul
Let all the music take control
Don't let it go
Walked by, we locked eyes
I'm not a wise guy, so I tried
But I won't lie, I'm kinda shy
Told the DJ to throw on some Revan rhymes
Sippin' straight sauce and Sprite like it's lemon-lime
My jaw dropped when you walked up
We talked and danced and sauced and we found love
Baby girl, tell me what's your number
Tell me what's your name
You've been on my brain
Drivin' me insane
Drivin'...yeah...

[Chrous: Mars Playground]
My shorty know how to party
But she don't know how to say sorry

Blood Rush,rap,Bookie,2011,210,"{Kurupt,""Omega G"",Sabataj}","[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Omega G]
Another click means more trouble, plenty your ass
Single life, droppin' the ways, vehicles and cash
Gettin' creative wit the drugs, mix the weed wit the hash
Get the liquor in your system, then you quick ta blast
Bein' faded is like steroids
Look at your chest, lift your head when you wit your boys
Tryin' ta make some noise
Personalities all the same, but swissy
Different faces like menage-a-trois, hit it and flee
To other states, get away, now I'm takin' this trip
No destination, move along, no more cig-a-retes
Stay empty handed, under one condition
Paraphenalia and pistol equals cop trippin'
Who needs the ass whippin'?
Playa hatas comin' wit excuse ta pop up
But I refuse to be a victim, so confront on the jump
I gives a fuck, who the hell they think I endin' out bust
Comin' from the A to Z, snitchas bleed from the gut
[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Bookie]
Uh, Uh
No relaxin' when I be testin', I ain't feelin' right
Got you blessin' from the correction', bustin' all night
Blood is rushin', from all the cussin', got a nigga flushin'
Any known nigga that's down for fussin', hands up
Niggas call me the captain nigga when I lead
Time ta serve with the permanent cut that's deep enough ta bleed
A demon, I'm out for the killin', so fuck the breathin'
Representin' my block, on the dice from the cops
On and on 'til it's all gone
Bookie's erasin' wit the domination, cuttin' like Jason
So turn the lights on
I won't feel it, behead a drastic for a niggas hearin'
Automatic enough ta panic, permanently spittin'
When I'm rollin', see I'm controllin', it's my destination
Now you knowin' just where I'm goin' wit my conversation
A real nigga you facin', gimme enough ta bust
And get a quick demonstration, representin' like Perry Mason
[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Sabataj]
Blood rush, slugs bust, ain't no love from us
What the fuck can I live wit the money I lust?
Trust God, but still trust all of my heat
]From the pumps to the .22's, ain't shit sweet?
Hustle and run streets, stack chips ta splurge
Bag chicks for the swerve 'til they get on my nerves
I know you heard how this nigga, cockin' name
Rain down on your parade, cats get sprayed
Y'all ain't even gotta name 'til you reach my stats
Peep my cats on the creep, jet black in the Ac
Packin' the mack like Big Pun, bust wit big guns
In it for the fame, but really the big funds
Leave you on the run, everytime you squeal
Y'all cats know the deal, I'ma bring it to you real
If you thinkin' of comin' wit it, you still gonna get it
Admit it, you just lost, you floss, it's blood rush
[Chorus]
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
Kill if you wanna kill, it's the blood rush
Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush

[Kurupt]
All I wanna do is make a dime
And remain unseen and hard ta find
It seems like everybody's tryin' ta snatch
Somethin' that I make, they tryin' ta take
I'm like fuck that shit
Why you all up on my back?
Just tryin' ta steal the rims off my Cadillac
Rollin' down the street rollin' back ta back
Dippin' down the street where my homies at
Why you like ta play alot?
Snatchin' everything that you see
And tryin' ta snatch from me
Money ain't shit, homeboy
You gots ta get all you can get, homeboy
Cock my pistol back and spit, homeboy
And this is one thing you can't forget, homeboy
My homeboy Bookie said dip homey
So began ta dippin'
And I ain't trippin'
Got my clip, unload the clip in
Everything started fallin'
Not givin' a fuck homey
I'm rollin' wit my dogs and
All the rest of y'all can just eat fat dicks
Like that muthafucka
Get back muthafucka
I pull out my strap
I let it clap like that
Muthafucka
Ya best ta get back
I bust a cap
Muthafucka
And when you see me in the Cut
Best believe it be that nigga Daz chillin' wit Kurupt
Muthafucka

Say what you wanna say, it's the blood rush
Brawl if you wanna brawl, it's the blood rush
Roll if you wanna ball, it's the blood rush
