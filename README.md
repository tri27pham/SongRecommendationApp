# SongRecommendationApp
An inital delve into the realm of machine learning. This project aims to analyse a large data set in order to train a machine learning model on identifying genres of music based on their lyrics and then be able to accurately determine music genres from previously unseen inputted lyrics. This genre will then be used along with a Spotify API in order to recommend similar songs to the user's inputted lyrics. The functionality will be presented within an Flutter app that will further an understanding of the Dart language and the Flutter framework.
